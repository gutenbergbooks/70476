<p class='c004'>“‘INDIA: THE PEARL OF PEARL RIVER,’ taking it all in
all, is the best work Mrs. Southworth has yet written. It is one
great merit in her fictions, that they faithfully delineate life and
manners, without entering on vexed social, religious, or political
issues. In ‘India,’ the reader will find a vivid delineation of the
South-West. But this is not all: the characters are boldly drawn,
the incidents natural, and the action of the story rapid and absorbing.
The two heroines are finely contrasted. The hero is a noble
creation; strong of will, earnest in purpose, firm for the right, and
persevering to the end in whatever he believes to be justice and
truth. We cannot recall, in any late work, a character so ideally
lofty, yet so faithful to reality. The heroic spirit in which he goes
West, abandoning the luxuries he has been accustomed to, and
settling down in his rude log hut, determined to conquer fortune
with his own good right hand, is, indeed, the true type of a self-relying
American. No fiction of Mrs. Southworth’s bears such
proofs of careful finish. It ought, on these several accounts, to
have a popularity unrivalled by any of her former works, spite of
the immense circulation they have attained.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“India!” exclaimed Mark Sutherland, rising at
the head of his table, and waving high the brimming
glass, while his fine dark countenance lighted up
with enthusiasm. A young Ajax in athletic beauty
and strength, stood the Mississippian, until—</p>

<p class='c005'>“India!” responded his friend Lauderdale, from the
foot of the table.</p>

<p class='c005'>“India!” echoed the young men around the board,
as they all arose, and, standing, honoured the toast.
Then the glasses jingled merrily down upon the table,
and then—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now that in blind faith we have worshipped your
goddess—who is India? Is it a woman or a quarter
of the globe—your idolatry?”</p>

you ready?—The Pearl of Pearl River!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The Pearl of Pearl River!” responded Lauderdale.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The Pearl of Pearl River!” re-echoed all those gay
youths, as this toast was also quaffed standing, and
the empty glasses rattled down upon the table.</p>

<p class='c005'>This was the parting toast, and the company broke
up to separate. The young guests all crowded around
their youthful host with adieus, regrets, congratulations,
and kind wishes; for all these opposite phrases
were equally appropriate, as will be seen.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mark Sutherland was the son and nephew of the
celebrated Pearl River planters—the three brothers
Sutherland. He was the prospective possessor of
three immense estates—being the heir of the first, betrothed
to the heiress of the second, and co-heir with
her to the third extensive plantation. He had just
concluded a brilliant collegiate course with distinguished
honour; he was soon to return south, to enter
upon his patrimony, and claim the hand of his
affianced bride, before he set forth upon his European
travels. And this was his valedictory entertainment,
given to his classmates. For him, indeed—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Filled was life’s goblet to the brim!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>No wonder those fine strong eyes danced with anticipation
as he shook hands right and left. He was,
up to this time, a frank, thoughtless, joyous, extravagant
fellow—selfish because he knew nothing of sorrow,
and wasteful because he knew nothing of want.
Affluent in youth, health, and love—affluent in wealth,
honour, and homage—he seemed to consider gold
valueless as dust, and deference only his just due.
He “the heir of all the ages” past of thought and toil,
had entered upon his intellectual inheritance with
great <i><span lang="fr">éclat</span></i>; but as yet not one mite had he added to
the store; not one thought had he bestowed upon the
great subjects that now engross all earnest minds.
Too full of youthful fire, vitality, love, hope, and joy,
for any grave thought or feeling to find room in his
brain or heart, was the planter’s son. How, indeed,
could earnest thought find entrance through such a
crowd of noisy joys to his heart? He stood upon
the threshold of the past, indeed, and his face was set
forward towards the future; but not one onward step
had he taken. Why should he trouble himself?
The bounteous future was advancing to him, smiling,
and laden with all the riches of life and time.</p>

<p class='c005'>But he stood, receiving the adieus of his young
friends, and dealing out wholesale and retail invitations
for all and each to come and visit him, for an
indefinite length of time, or until they were tired. At
last they were all gone, except Lauderdale, his chum,
who was passing some days with him, as his guest, at
the Minerva House.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You are an enviable dog, Sutherland,” exclaimed
the latter, clapping him sharply upon the shoulder.
“You are a deuced enviable villain! By my soul, it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>is enough to make a poor man like me dissatisfied
with his lot, or the present arrangements of society,
which amounts to precisely the same thing, I suppose.
Deuce take me, if it is not enough to make me
turn Agrarian, Chartist, Radical, or whatever may be
the new name for the old discontent! Just contrast
our positions! Here are you, at one-and-twenty years
of age, entirely free from all toil and care for the whole
remainder of your life. You will now return to a
sumptuous southern home, on a magnificent estate,
where troops of friends wait to welcome you, and
troops of slaves attend to serve you, and where your
bride, the very pearl of beauty, dreams of and languishes
for your presence; and, above all—yes, I
speak reflectingly, above <em>all</em>—more than sumptuous
home, and troops of friends, and trains of servants,
and blushing bride—where, lying perdue at your service,
is a plenty of the root of all evil—</p>

<p class='c014'>While I!—well, I shall just plod on in the old way,
teaching school one half the year to pay my college
expenses for the other, until I find myself in some
lawyer’s shop, in arrears with my landlady, in debt to
my washerwoman—detesting to walk up the street,
because I should pass the tailor’s store—abhorring to
walk down it, because I should be sure to see the
shoemaker standing in his door. With no more comfort
or convenience in my life than can be enjoyed
between my little back-chamber, up four pair of stairs
in a cheap boarding-house, and the straight-backed
chair and high-topped desk of the law shop. And no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>more love, or hope, or poetry, in my life, than may be
found bound up between the covers of Coke upon
Lyttleton. Or perhaps I shall turn private tutor, and
advertise, ‘A highly respectable young gentleman, a
graduate of Yale College, wishes to obtain,’ &#38;c.; and
you, who will be by this time the grave head of a
family, with several little domestic liabilities, will
probably answer the advertisement; and I shall find
myself teaching the names of the keys of knowledge
to young Mark and his brothers. Oh!”——</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! ha!” laughed Sutherland.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, <em>you’ll</em> patronise me, rather! <em>You’ll</em> be kind
to me; for you’ll say to yourself and friends, ‘He was
a college friend of mine, poor fellow.’ I fancy I hear
and see you saying it now, with that careless, cordial,
jolly condescension of yours.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! My <em>dear</em> Lincoln!
My <em>dear</em> fellow, why should that be? Why should
you be pettifogger or pedagogue, unless you have a
vocation for it? Why should anybody do what they
don’t want to do? Life is rich—full of wealth, and
love, and joy, and glory. Enter and take possession.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Enter and take possession! Yes, that is what <em>you</em>
can do. Life is full of wealth, and love, and joy, and
glory, for <em>you</em>, indeed; and you can afford to mock
me with those words! But, never mind, my fine
flamingo! I have heard the wise say that happiness
is not so unequally distributed, after all. And I, for
one, don’t believe this cake of comfort is going to be
so very unjustly divided between us, or that you will
have all the white sugar on the top, and I all the burnt
paper at the bottom.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>“See here, my friend, remember that we good-for-nothing
Mississippians are not initiated into the mysteries
of the kitchen, and therefore I don’t understand
your culinary figure of speech at all.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, go on! go on! You’re a young bear!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“A young bear! Comrades! Oh, they are all
gone! A young bear? Oh, I suppose he alludes
to my black whiskers and hair, and my shag over
coat!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I mean <em>your</em> trouble is all before you!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Trouble? Oh, my dear boy, that is a word with
out a meaning! Trouble? What <em>is</em> trouble? What
idea is the word designed to represent? Trouble?
Oh, my dear fellow, it is all a mistake, a mere notion,
a superstition, a prejudice; a saying of old folks, who,
being near the verge of departure from this bright,
glad, joyous, jubilant world, vainly try to console
themselves by slandering it as a world of trouble, and
talk of a <em>better</em> one, to which they are progressing. If
this world in itself is not ‘good,’ as the Creator pronounced
it to be in the beginning, by all the rules of
comparison, how can any other world be said to be
better?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, I believe in the better world as much as
they do; but look you! the pleasantest notion I have
of Heaven is its being—being”——</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, don’t let it go any further—as <em>good</em> as this
world, and only better as far as it endures longer.
<em>This</em> world is full of all that is great and glorious for
enjoyment! And, Lincoln, my fine fellow, enter and
take possession! <em>Don’t</em> teach or study law! <em>Don’t</em>
plod; it is ungentlemanly. Somebody, I suppose, must
teach and study law, and do such things—but don’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span><em>you</em>. Do you leave it to those a—those persons a—those
in fact who have the plebeian instinct of labor;
you apprehend? They really <em>enjoy</em> work now! Just
think of it! I suppose that gracious nature, intending
them to carry on the work of the world, endowed
them with a <em>taste for it</em>! Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! ha!
But <em>I</em>’ve no vocation for it! Neither have you, my
dear boy. Don’t force your nature in an opposite
direction to which it tends, therefore! Enter life, and
take possession!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Humph! thank you! This is to say, ‘follow my
attractions,’ and if they ‘attract’ me to lead an idle
life, and live upon other people, why, so much the
better—they are my attractions; and if they ‘attract’
me to pick my host’s pocket, or run away with his
daughter, it is the same thing by the same law.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ha! ha! ha! Oh, certainly; remembering that
your host might experience an attraction to blow your
brains out.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Pleasant points to be drawn to. I guess I shall not
follow my attractions! I’ll stick to the little law shop,
and relieve weariness by grumbling. Some distinguished
men have emerged from those little law dens;
and, by the way, seriously, my dear Mark, I think that
I, that you, even <em>you</em>, possess those very qualities out
of which <em>really</em> distinguished men are formed, and that
if destiny had not ‘thrust’ a sort of moneyed and
landed greatness upon you, that even <em>you</em> would
‘achieve’ some judicial, political, diplomatic, or intellectual
greatness of some sort.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ha! ha! ha! even <em>I</em>! Well, that is a stretch of
possibility, indeed. Even <em>I</em>, humph! <i><span lang="fr">Mais à nos
moutons.</span></i> Will you come home with me? Do come
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>and be my guest <i><span lang="fr">à éternité</span></i>—or until you win some
rich Mississippi beauty. Woo beauty, not Blackstone,
for a fortune. You have so much more genius for the
first than for the last, my fine fellow.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, then you would have me turn fortune-hunter,
and, under cover of your friendship and introduction,
aim at some heiress, and bring her down, and so secure
wealth?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Set fire to you, <em>no</em>! Whom do you take me for?
Do you think that <em>I</em> would present an adventurer to
Southern creoles? <em>No, sir!</em> But I <em>do</em> want you to
fall in love with a Southern beauty, and fortune would
follow, of course.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I do not see it at all. There are several links
wanting in that chain of reasoning. But, apropos of
beauty, love, and marriage. Tell me something more
of Miss Sutherland, <i><span lang="fr">votre belle fiancée</span></i>.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“India! listen, you.” And he took Lauderdale’s
arm, and turned to walk up and down the room for
a confidential chat. “Listen, you! I named her just
now over the wine. I regret to have done so. Would
it were undone! But so it is; in some moment of excitement
a word passes our lips, and it is unrecallable
forever. She is so sacred to my heart, so divine to
my soul! I often wonder if Helen of Argos were
half as beautiful as she—my India.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What a strange, charming name that is for a
woman!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Is it not? But, rich, luxurious, and gorgeous, in
its associations, too—(and that is why it was given to
her) it suits her. She is India. Her mother was like
her—a beautiful, passionate Havanienne, rich in genius,
poetry, song—luxuriating in the beautiful creations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>of others, yet far too indolent to create. More than
all, she lost herself amid the oriental elysiums of Moore,
and thence she named her only daughter Hinda. And
as the maiden budded and bloomed into womanhood—well,
yes, I believe, after all, it was I who softened
down her name to India. It has the same derivation,
it is the same name, in fact. Oh! and it suits her.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Describe your nonpareil to me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I cannot. By my soul’s idolatry, I cannot. The
best of beauty—the charm, the soul, the divine of
beauty—can never be described or painted. It is
spiritual, and can only be perceived.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Humph! is she fair?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No—yet radiant.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dark?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No—yet shadowy.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Is she tall?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Short?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, no; nonsense!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What, neither tall nor short? Perhaps she is of
medium height.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I do not know. I cannot tell, indeed. But
oh! she is beautiful—she is glorious! My lady, my
queen!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“To come to something tangible, what is the colour
of her eyes?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh! what is the colour of love, or joy, or heaven?
for as soon could I tell you the colour of these as of
her witching eyes. I only know they have light,
softly thrilling all the chords of life, like music; and
shadows, calming my spirit, like silence.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, I admit the hue of beautiful eyes to be a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>mysterious point; but hair, now, is a little more certain
in that respect. Tell me the hue of your lady’s
tresses.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I cannot. I only know they are rich, warm, and
lustrous.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Humph! satisfactory portrait that. Oh! here is
Flamingo. Come, Flame, and tell me what is the
colour of your young mistress’s hair.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The latter part of this speech was addressed to Mr.
Sutherland’s valet, who had just entered. Flamingo
was a character in his way; a handsome, bright mulatto,
with quite a “wealth” of bushy black silky hair
and whiskers. Very mercurial in temperament, and
excessively fond of dress, he presented quite as gay
and gorgeous an exterior as the famous feathered
biped, his namesake. Flamingo stood for a moment
in a quandary, at the suddenness and novelty of the
question put to him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, come, now; you are not poetically bewildered.
Can’t you tell us the colour of the lady’s
hair?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“De colour o’ Miss Inda’s hair, sir—a—yes, sir—its—its—’bout
de colour o’ ‘lasses taffy, when you’re
’bout half done pullin’ of it, an’ it’s shining.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Molasses taffy! Out, you wretch! It is amber-hued,
Lauderdale—<em>amber-hued</em>, understand; the rich,
warm, lustrous hue of amber. Molasses taffy! Oh,
villain! To think I could not find a comparison in all
nature precious enough for those precious tresses, and
he should compare them to molasses taffy! Out of my
sight, beast! <em>Molasses taffy! Pah!</em>” exclaimed Sutherland,
in disgust, while Lauderdale laughed aloud, and
Flamingo vanished into the adjoining chamber, where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>he turned on the gas, and busied himself in making
the apartment comfortable for the night.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Come, let’s get out of this mess before the waiters
come to clear away the service. Look! This is one
of the things that always make me melancholy,” said
Sutherland, pointing to the disordered table.</p>

<p class='c005'>Both young men were about to retire, when Sutherland
again clasped the hand of his friend and said—“But
you have not yet told me whether you will
accompany me home. Come, laying all jesting and
raillery aside, you know how happy I should be to
have you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And you know what I have told you before, my
dear Sutherland, that I must go to New York for the
anniversary week. And by the way, my dear Damon,
why cannot you stop a few days before you go South,
and attend some of these meetings?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Me! Heavens! You shock me! You deprive
me of words—of breath! <em>I!</em> a Mississippian! Why,
look you; if I were to attend one of those meetings,
and if it should be known in my neighborhood, my
friends would turn me off, my uncles disinherit me,
and my father rise from his grave to reproach me.
Sir, my friends and relatives are ‘of the most straitest
sect of the Pharisees!’”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And do you share their opinions?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Opinions? Opinions, my dear fellow! I have no
opinions. Opinions, it appears to me, are the currency
of—of—those who have nothing else to offer in exchange
for a living.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Levity! Oh, Mark, how you sin against your own
fine mind!”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>“Oh! come, come, come, no more of that. ‘Sir,
praise is very flat, except from the fair sex.’”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ah! I see you are hopelessly flighty to-night.
Good night.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Good night. Stay; you <em>will</em> go with me?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No; unless you first accompany me to New York,
and remain through the anniversary week, and attend
the meetings.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And hear myself traduced, slandered, abused,
cursed! A pleasant invitation—thank you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And get yourself <em>dis</em>abused of many things, you
should rather say. See here, Mark, my proposition is
perfectly fair and reasonable, and has a meaning in
it. Observe: you invite me to the South, and laughingly
promise that an actual acquaintance with the
patriarchal system shall cool what you call my fever;
and that a Southern bride with two hundred negroes,
shall completely cure it. Well, I am reasonable. I
am open to conviction. I am willing to try it—to
examine the ‘peculiar institution’ with the utmost
impartiality. Nor do I fear or doubt the result. But
observe further. Both of us, it seems, have heard but
one side of this great question. I therefore consent to
go with you to the South, and spend some weeks on a
cotton plantation, only on condition that you accompany
me to New York, and attend the anniversary
meetings. In a word, I will <em>see</em> your side of the
question, if you will <em>hear</em> ours.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll do it, I’ll go,” exclaimed Sutherland, laughing,
and clapping his hand cordially into that of Lauderdale.
“I’ll go, nor have <em>I</em> any doubt or fear as to
the result.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The sun shines on no more beautiful and entrancing
region than the vale of Pearl river. It is the Elysium
of the sunny south, reposing between the rich alluvial
lands of the Mississippi, and the fragrant<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c015'><sup>[1]</sup></a> pine forests
of the Pascagoula. The green land of the valley
seems to roll in gentle undulations, like the waves of
a calm sea. Between the swelling hills, or rather
waves of verdure, flow crystal streams towards the
bosom of the Pearl. These lovely hills are capped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>with groves of the most beautiful and odoriferous of
the southern flowering trees. These charming streams
are shaded with the most fragrant and delightful of
the flowering shrubs and vines. Here nature throws
around her riches with an unsparing hand and a
wonderful exuberance of luxury. Birds of the most
brilliant plumage and enchanting melody fill all the
summer groves, at early morn and eve, with their
perfect music. Flowers of countless varieties, and
most beautiful forms and hues, laden all the air with
their ambrosial perfume. The breeze is charged with
music and fragrance, as from the spicy groves of
Araby the Blest.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c005'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. All who have travelled through or near the pine woods of Mississippi
know the effect of the southern sun upon these trees, ripening and rarefying
from them a most grateful and salubrious fragrance, called the
“terebinthine odour.” The effect of the climate is still more obvious upon
ornamental trees and flowers. Those that lose much of their luxuriant
beauty and fragrance in the North, attain in the South their utmost perfection.</p>
</div>

<p class='c005'>If in this garden—this conservatory of Nature,
where all her choicest luxuries are assembled—there
is one spot more favoured than all the rest, it is “Cashmere,”
the beautiful seat of Clement Sutherland.</p>

<p class='c005'>The brothers Sutherland emigrated from the old
dominion, and settled on the Pearl river, in those
palmy days of cotton-planting, when every planter
seemed a very Midas, turning all he touched to gold,
and when the foundations were laid of some of the
present enormous southern fortunes. It was no love
for the land of sun that brought the Sutherlands there.
They had heard that the common annual profits of
the cotton crops were from ten to eighty thousand
dollars; and they had sold their tobacco plantation on
the Potomac, and emigrated to the valley of the Pearl.
The spot selected by the brothers was that Eden of
the valley where the Pearl river turns with a serpentine
bend in the form of an S with an additional
curve, shaping the land into two round points to the
west, and one—the largest and loveliest—to the east.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>The east point had been taken up by Clement Sutherland,
the eldest of the brothers, and the west points
by the two others. Thus Clement Sutherland’s plantation
lay embosomed between those of his brethren.
On the upper side lay that of Mark, the second
brother, and on the lower, that of Paul, the third and
bachelor brother.</p>

<p class='c005'>Very early in life, and some years previous to their
emigration, Mark Sutherland had been united in
marriage to a lady of St. Mary’s—one of the noblest
of Maryland’s noble daughters. From her, their only
son, Mark Sutherland, the younger, inherited a strong
mind, warm heart, and high spirit; from his father he
took the stalwart form, athletic strength, and dark and
sometimes terrible beauty, that marked the race of
Sutherland.</p>

<p class='c005'>Clement Sutherland had remained unmarried until
long after his settlement upon the Pearl. But one
autumn, while on a visit to New Orleans, to negotiate
the sale of his cotton, he chanced to meet a beautiful
West Indian girl, whom he afterwards wooed and
won for his bride. Whether the sweet Havanienne,
or the large fortune of which she was the sole heiress,
was the object of his worship, was a mooted point by
those who knew him best. It is probable he adored
both. Certainly no slightest wish or whim of the
lovely Creole remained unsatisfied. It was she who
gave the charming scene of his home the appropriate
name of Cashmere. She it was who persuaded him
to pause in his incessant, exclusive thinking, talking,
and acting, about cotton-growing, and his mad pursuit
of gain, to build and adorn an elegant villa upon
the site of the temporary framed house to which he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>had brought the beautiful <i><span lang="fr">épicurienne</span></i>. Her rare artistic
taste presided over the architecture and embellishment
of the mansion, and the laying out and ornamenting
of the grounds. But here the evanescent energy of
the indolent West Indian died out. She was, at best,
but a lovely and fragile spring flower, that faded and
fell ere the summer of her life had come. She left a
child of perfect beauty—a little girl—who inherited
her mother’s graceful harmony of form and complexion,
and her father’s strength and vigour of constitution.</p>

<p class='c005'>Immediately after the death of her mother, the
orphaned infant had been taken home by her aunt,
Mrs. Mark Sutherland, to share the maternal cares
bestowed upon her only son. The lady gave herself
up to the rearing and education of these children.
And not the noble mother of the Gracchi was prouder
of her “jewels” than Mrs. Sutherland of hers. Thus
the infancy and childhood of Mark and Hinda were
passed together—the same mother’s heart, the same
nursery, the same school-room, nay, the same book,
with their heads together, and their black and golden
locks mingled, were shared by the children. And no
Guinea mice or turtle doves were ever fonder of each
other than our boy and girl.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was a woful day when they were first separated—Mark
to enter college, and Hinda to be placed at a
fashionable boarding-school. Tears fell on both sides,
like spring showers. Young Mark, when laughed at
for his girlish tears, angrily rejoined, that it was no
shame to weep; that the renowned hero, Achilles, had
wept when they took Briseis away from him, also
when his friend Patroclus was slain.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>Paul Sutherland, the third brother, had remained
up to the present time unmarried, with the determination
to continue so until the end of his life. He
bestowed his affections with paternal pride and devotion
upon his niece and nephew, resolving to make
them his joint heirs, and with his own large property
swell the enormous bulk of theirs. Just two years
previous to the opening of our story, the Pearl river
trio had been broken by the death of Mark Sutherland,
the elder. Young Sutherland had hastened
home to console his widowed mother, but not long
did the widow permit him to remain. The lady sent
him back at the commencement of the next following
term.</p>

<p class='c005'>But it is time to describe more particularly Cashmere,
the charming seat of Clement Sutherland, and
the principal scene of our drama. The estate itself
was a very extensive one, comprising several thousand
acres of the richest land in the vale. That part
of the plantation on which the villa had been erected
lay in a bend of the Pearl river, surrounded on three
sides—north, east, and south—by its pellucid waters.
The whole of this area is occupied by the mansion and
ornamental grounds.</p>

<p class='c005'>The villa itself is a very elegant edifice of white
freestone, fronting the river. The building is long
and broad, in proportion to its height—this being the
necessary plan of all southern mansions, to save them
from the effects of the terrible tornadoes that sweep
over the country, and to which a higher elevation
would expose them. But the mansion is relieved from
all appearance of heaviness, by a light and elegant
Ionic colonnade, sustaining an open verandah running
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>around three sides of the building. On the
fourth side, looking to the south, the aspect is diversified
by a large bay window projecting from the
lower story, and an elegant Venetian balcony from
the upper one.</p>

<p class='c005'>The villa is also shaded on three sides—north, west,
and south—by a grove of the most beautiful and fragrant
of the southern trees—the splendid tulip-poplar,
lifting to the skies its slender shaft, crested with
elegantly-shaped leaves of the most brilliant and
intense verdure, and crowned with its bell-shaped
flowers of the most vivid and gorgeous flame colour;
the beautiful cotton-wood tree, softly powdered over
with its formless snowy blossoms; the queenly magnolia-grandiflora,
with its glittering green foliage and
dazzling white flowers and rich oppressive aroma;
the pretty red-bud, with its umbrella-shaped top, its
crumpled, heart-shaped leaves, and scarlet tufts; the
bois-d’arc, in full bloom, the most splendid and magnificent
of ornamental trees, uniting the rarest qualities
of the orange tree and the catalpa; the chinidine,
with its vivid green foliage and brilliant purple flowers,
dropping delicious but heavy narcotic odours, weighing
down the nerves and brain into luxurious repose,
and stupefying the very birds that shelter in its
aromatic shades, so that they may be taken captive
with the bare hand; the imperial catalpa, sovereign
of the grove by virtue of the grandeur and elegance
of its form, the grace and beauty of its foliage, and
the ambrosial perfume of its flowers, filling all the
air around with its delightful fragrance; and many,
many others, so various, beautiful, and aromatic, that
one is lost and entranced amid the luxuriating wealth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>of the grove. Birds of the most splendid plumage
and the most exquisite melody—the goldfinch, the
oriole, the redbird, the paroquet, the nightingale,
swallow, and innumerable others, shelter here, and
their songs fill the air with music. No artificial walk
disfigures the sward. The green and velvety turf
affords the softest, coolest footing. Rustic seats of
twisted bow-wood are under the trees; here and
there fountains of crystal water leap, sparkle, and
fall, ever playing silvery accompaniments to the
song of birds; statues of Diana, Pan, and the wood-nymphs,
peopled the grove. Its shades are the delightful
resort of the Sutherlands and their friends, to
enjoy the freshness and brilliancy of the morning, to
find shelter from the burning rays of the sun at noon,
or to luxuriate in the delicious breeze of the evening.
This Arcadian grove, as has been said, surrounded
the house on three sides—north, west, and south.</p>

<p class='c005'>The east is the front of the house towards the river.
The view here is open, and the most beautiful,
charming, and variegated, to be imagined.</p>

<p class='c005'>From the colonnaded verandah a flight of broad
marble steps lead to a terrace carpeted with grass, and
planted with rose-bushes—the Damascus, the Provence,
the scarlet, the white, the multiflora, the moss
rose; daily, monthly, and perpetual roses; “roses—everywhere
roses”—such a luxuriant exuberance of
roses upon this velvety terrace. The rose terrace is
divided from the lawn by a <em>treillage</em> of the most delicate
and elaborate trellis-work; and this also is
wreathed and festooned by running rose vines.</p>

<p class='c005'>Below this spreads the lawn on every side, not level,
but gently waving, and covered with grass as soft, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>smooth, and as downy as velvet; and everywhere the
eye roves with pleasure over a turf of brilliant intense
green, except where it is variegated with the floral
mosaic work of gay parterres, or trellised arbours, or
reservoirs, or single magnificent forest trees left
standing in honour of their monarchal grandeur. The
parterres are rich, beautiful, and fragrant beyond description;
there our hothouse plants bloom in the
open air; and there our common garden flowers—violets,
lilies, roses, myrtles, irises, and innumerable
others—flourish with surpassing luxuriance. The
arbours, of delicate trellis-work and elegant form, are
shaded and adorned with running vines of rich Armenean
and cape jessamine, honeysuckles, and woodbine.
The reservoirs contain gold fish, and other ornamental
specimens of the piscatorial kingdom.</p>

<p class='c005'>This extensive and beautiful lawn is surrounded by
an iron open-work fencing, very light and elegant in
appearance, yet very strong and impassable. Three
ornamented gates relieve the uniformity of this iron
trellis; one on the north leads through to the orange
groves, always inviting and delightful, whether in full
bloom, and shedding ambrosial perfume in the spring,
or laden with their golden fruit in the fall. The gate
on the north admitted into the vineyard, where every
variety of the finest and rarest grapes flourished in
luxuriant abundance. The one on the east is central
between these two others, and leads from the lawn
down to the white and pebbly beach of the Pearl,
where pretty boats are always moored for the convenience
of the rambler who might desire to cross the
river.</p>

<p class='c005'>And then the curving river itself is well named the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>Pearl, from the soft, semi-transparent glow of roseate,
whitish, or saffron tints, caught from the heavens.</p>

<p class='c005'>Across the soft water, in rich contrast, lie hills, and
groves, and cotton-fields—the latter, one of the gayest
features in southern scenery. They are sometimes a
mile square. They are planted in straight rows, six
feet apart; and the earth between them, of a rich
Spanish-red colour, is kept entirely clean from weeds.
The plants grow to the height of seven feet, and spread
in full-leaved branches, bearing brilliant white and
gold-hued flowers. When in full bloom, a cotton-field
by itself is a gorgeous landscape. Beyond these
hills, and groves, and cotton fields, are other cotton-fields,
and groves, and hills, extending on and on,
until afar off they blend with the horizon, in soft, indistinct
hues, mingled together like the tints of the
clouds.</p>

<p class='c005'>I have led you through the beautiful grounds immediately
around and in front of the villa; but behind
the mansion, and back of the grove, there are gardens
and orchards, and still other fields of cotton and outhouses,
and offices, and the negro village called “The
Quarters.”</p>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>She has halls and she has vassals, and the resonant steam eagles</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Follow fast on the directing of her floating dove-like hand,</div>
      <div class='line'>With a thunderous vapour trailing underneath the starry vigils,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>So to mark upon the blasted heavens the measure of her lands.</div>
      <div class='line'><em>Mrs. Browning.</em></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>The summer sun had just sunk below the horizon,
leaving all the heavens suffused with a pale golden
and roseate light, that falls softly on the semi-transparent
waters of the Pearl, flowing serenely on between
its banks of undulating hills and dales, and
green and purple lights and glooms. No jarring sight
or sound breaks the voluptuous stillness of the scene
and hour. The golden light has faded from the
windows and balconies of the villa, and sunk with the
sunken sun. An evening breeze is rising from the distant
pine woods, that will soon tempt the inmates forth
to enjoy its exhilarating and salubrious freshness and
fragrance. But as yet all is quiet about the mansion.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the innermost sanctuary of that house reposes
Miss Sutherland. It is the most elegant of a sumptuous
suit of apartments, upon which Mr. Sutherland
had spared no amount of care or expense—having
summoned from New Orleans a French <i><span lang="fr">artiste</span></i>, of distinguished
genius in his profession, to superintend
their interior architecture, furnishing and adornment.</p>

<p class='c005'>The suit consists of a boudoir, two drawing-rooms,
a hall or picture gallery, a music room, a double
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>parlour, a library, and dining and breakfast rooms;
and, by the machinery of grooved doors, all these
splendid apartments may be thrown into one magnificent
saloon.</p>

<p class='c005'>But the most finished and perfect of the suite is the
luxurious boudoir of India. It is a very bower of
beauty and love, a <i><span lang="fr">chef d’œuvre</span></i> of artistic genius, a
casket worthy to enshrine the Pearl of Pearl River.</p>

<p class='c005'>There she reposes in the recess of the bay window,
“silk-curtained from the sun.” This bay window is
the only one in the apartment; it is both deep and
lofty, and is a small room in itself. It is curtained
off from the main apartment by drapery of purple
damask satin, lined with gold-coloured silk, and festooned
by gold cords and tassels. The interior of the
recess is draped with thin gold-coloured silk alone;
and the evening light, glowing through it, throws a
warm, rich, lustrous atmosphere around the form of
Oriental beauty, reposing on the silken couch in the
recess.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is a rare type of beauty, not easy to realise by
your imagination, blending the highest charms of the
spiritual, the intellectual, and the sensual, in seeming
perfect harmony; it is a costly type of beauty, possessed
often only at a fearful discount of happiness;
it is a dangerous organisation, full of fatality to its
possessor and all connected with her; for that lovely
and voluptuous repose resembles the undisturbed
serenity of the young leopardess, or the verdant and
flowery surface of the sleeping volcano. It is a richly
and highly gifted nature, but one that, more than all
others, requires in early youth the firm and steady
guidance of the wise and good, and that in after life
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>needs the constant controlling influence of Christian
principle.</p>

<p class='c005'>India Sutherland has never known another guide
than her own good pleasure. “Queen o’er herself”
she is <em>not</em>, indeed, unhappily; but queen instead over
father and lover, friends, relatives, and servants. In
truth hers is a gentle and graceful reign. It could
not be otherwise, over subjects so devoted as hers.
All of them, from Mr. Sutherland her father, down to
Oriole her bower-maid, deem it their best happiness
to watch, anticipate, and prevent her wants; and she
is pleased to repay such devotion with lovely smiles
and loving words. She is, indeed, the tamest as well as
the most beautiful young leopardess that ever sheathed
claws and teeth in the softest down. She is no hypocrite;
she is perfectly sincere; but her deepest nature
is unawakened, undeveloped. She knows no more,
no, nor as much, as you now do, of the latent strength,
fire, and cruelty of those passions which opposition
might provoke. There she lay, as unconscious of the
seeds of selfishness and tyranny as Nero was, when,
at seventeen years of age, he burst into tears at signing
the first death-warrant. Awful spirits sleep in the
vasty depths of our souls—awful in goodness or in
evil—and vicissitudes are the Glendowers that can
call them forth. There she lies, all unconscious of the
coming struggle, “a perfect form in perfect rest.” A
rich dress of light material, yet dark and brilliant
colours, flows gracefully around her beautiful figure.
She reclines upon a crimson silken couch, her face
slightly turned downwards, her head supported by
her hand, and her eyes fixed upon a book that lies
open upon the downy pillow; a profusion of smooth,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>shining, amber-hued ringlets droop around her graceful
Grecian head; her eyebrows are much darker, and
are delicately pencilled; her eyelashes are also dark
and long, and shade large eyes of the deepest blue;
her complexion is very rich, of a clear warm brown,
deepening into a crimson blush upon cheeks and lips
the brighter and warmer now that the book beneath
her eyes absorbs her quite. The light through the
golden-hued drapery of the window pours a warm,
subdued effulgence over the whole picture. On a
cushion below her couch sits a little quadroon girl,
of perfect beauty, fanning her mistress with a fan of
ostrich plumes; and while she sways the graceful
feathers to and fro, her dark eyes, full of affection and
innocent admiration, are fixed upon the beautiful
epicurienne.</p>

<p class='c005'>When the rising of the evening breeze began to
swell the gold-hued curtains, Oriole dropped her fan,
but continued to sit and watch lovingly the features
of her lady. When the purple shades of evening
began to fall around, Oriole arose softly, and drew
back the curtains on their golden wires, to let in more
light and air, revealing the terrace of roses, the lawn
and its groves and reservoirs, and the lovely rose and
amber-clouded Pearl, rolling on between its banks
of undulating light and shade; and giving to view,
besides, the figure of a lady standing upon the terrace
of roses, and who immediately advanced smiling,
and threw in a shower of rose-leaves over the recumbent
reader, exclaiming—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Will that wake you? <i><span lang="fr">Mon Dieu!</span></i> What is it you
are idling over? The breeze is up, and playing a
prelude through the pine tops and cane-brakes, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>the birds are about to break forth in their evening
song. Will you come out?”</p>

<p class='c005'>The speaker was a lady of about twenty-five years
of age, of petite form, delicate features, dark and brilliant
complexion, and sprightly countenance, which
owed its fascination to dazzling little teeth, and ripe
lips bowed with archness, great sparkling black eyes
full of mischief, and jetty ringlets in whose very intricacies
seemed to lurk a thousand innocent conspiracies.
She was dressed in mourning, if that dress could be
called mourning which consisted of a fine light black
tissue over black silk, and a number of jet bracelets
set in gold, that adorned the whitest, prettiest arms
in the world, and a jet necklace that set off the whiteness
of the prettiest throat and bosom. Mrs. Vivian,
of New Orleans—Annette Valeria Vivian—spirituelle
Valerie—piquant Nan!—the widow of a wealthy merchant,
a distant relative of Mrs. Sutherland by her
mother’s side, and now with her step-daughter on a
visit of some weeks here at “Cashmere.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“<i><span lang="fr">Ciel!</span></i> then do you hear me? What volume of
birds or flowers do you prefer to the living birds and
flowers out here? What <em>book</em> (pardieu!) of poetry do
you like better than the gorgeous pastoral poem
spread around us? <i><span lang="fr">Mon Dieu!</span></i> she does not hear
me yet! India, I say!” exclaimed the impatient
little beauty, throwing in another shower of rose
petals.</p>

<p class='c005'>Miss Sutherland, languid and smiling, rose from
her recumbent posture, and handed her the volume.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Pope! by all that is solemnly in earnest! Pope’s
Essay on Man, by all that is grave, serious and awful!
Why, I thought at the very worst it was some Flora’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>Annual, or Gems of the Aviary, or some other of the
embossed and gilded trifles that litter your rooms.
But Pope’s Essay on Man! Why, I should as soon
have expected to find you studying a work on tanning
and currying!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, hush, you tease! And tell me what these
lines mean. I have been studying them for the last
half hour, and can’t make them out.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“<em>You</em> studying! Ha! ha! ha! You doing anything!
By the way, I have been trying to discover
what office I hold near the person of our Queen. I
have just this instant found out that I am thinker in
ordinary to her gracious majesty.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, dear Nan, do credit to your post—think me
out these lines,” said the beauty, languidly sinking
back upon her couch.</p>

<p class='c005'>“But what lines do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oriole, show them to her. Oh, never mind, you
don’t know them. Hand me the book, Nan! Here,
here are the lines—now make out a meaning for them,
if you can:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘And binding nature fast in fate,</div>
      <div class='line'>Left free the human will.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“Well,” said Mrs. Vivian, laughing, “it sounds
very like—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘And tying Adam hand and foot,</div>
      <div class='line'>Bid him get up and walk!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>And it <em>looks</em> as if it might have been written by Uncle
Billy Bothsides! Ah, by the way, here he comes.
Talk of the evil one, and—you know the rest. Ah, I
shall be amused to hear his opinion of the sentiment
in question. It is just in his way.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>I am sure that I shall never be able to do justice to
the gentleman that was now seen advancing from the
lawn—Mr. William I. Bolling, as he called himself;
Billy Bolling, as he was called by his brothers-in-law;
Bolling Billy, as called by his boon companions of
the bowling alley; Uncle Billy, by the young people;
Marse Billy, by the negroes; and Billy Bothsides, by
everybody else. He was a short, fat, little gentleman,
of about fifty years of age, and clothed in an immaculate
suit of white linen, with a fresh broad-brimmed
straw hat, which as he walked he carried in one hand,
while in the other he flourished out a perfumed linen
handkerchief, with which he wiped his face and rubbed
his head. His little head was covered with fine light
hair, that did not shade, but curled itself tightly off
from his round, rosy, good-natured face, full of cheerfulness,
candour, and conceit. The damper or the
warmer the weather, or the more excited state of
Uncle Billy’s feelings, then the redder grew his face
and the tighter curled off his flaxen hair.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Bolling was one of those social and domestic
ne’er-do-wells of which every large family connection
may rue its specimen—one of those idle hangers-on
to others, of which almost every southern house does
penance with at least one. He was a brother of Mrs.
Mark Sutherland, but no credit to his sister or their
mutual family; though, to use his own qualifying
style, neither was he any dishonour to them. He was
a bachelor. He said it was by his own free election
that he led a <em>single</em> life, though he vowed he very
much preferred a <em>married</em> life; that nothing could be
justly compared to the blessings of celibacy, except
the beatitude of matrimony. He compromised with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>the deficiency of every other sort of importance by a
large surplus of <em>self</em>-importance. He valued himself
mostly upon what he called his cool blood, clear
head, and perfect impartiality of judgment. He was
not to be seduced by love or bribed by money to any
sort of partisanship. And as there are two sides to
most questions under the sun, and as Mr. Bolling
would look impartially upon positive and negative
at once, so Billy</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Won himself an everlasting name.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>He now came up to the bay window, wiping his
face, and fanning himself, and saying—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Good evening, ladies! It is a perfectly delightful
evening—though, to be sure, it is insufferably warm.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mrs. Vivian immediately challenged him with, “Mr. Bolling,
we are anxious to know your opinion upon
these lines of Pope;” and she read them to him, and
put the book in his hands. He took it, and wiped
his face, and fanned himself—but these cooling operations
seemed to heat him all the more, for his face
grew very red and his flaxen hair crisped tightly as
he gazed upon the page, and said: “Eh, yes, that’s
all right—certainly!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“We believe it right, but what does it mean?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mean! Why, <em>this</em> is what it means—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Binding nature fast in fate,</div>
      <div class='line'>Left free the human will;’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>certainly—yes.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Please to explain yourself, Mr. Bolling,” said the
widow, while India gazed on in languid amusement.</p>

<p class='c005'>Uncle Billy wiped his forehead, and said, “Why
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>I don’t think ladies understand these grave theological
matters.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, but you can enlighten us, Mr. Bolling.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You see these lines comprise the profoundest problems
of philosophy—so profound as to perplex the
understandings of the greatest scholars and philosophers
that have ever lived; so profound, in fact, as to
be quite unintelligible even to me—yet so simple as
to be easily comprehended by the narrowest intellect—so
simple as to be clear even to you, or to Fly
here.”</p>

<p class='c005'>This was said of a small boy who at that instant
appeared with a basket of oranges.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Fly, do you know what your master William is
talking about?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, ma’am; politics.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Exactly,” smiled Valeria; “go on, Mr. Bolling.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“<em>Hem!</em> Observe, Mrs. Vivian, that there is an analogy
all through nature—physical, mental, moral,
spiritual.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes. Fly, listen—what is he talking about now?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Physic and sparrits, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That is right. Pray go on, Mr. Bolling.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes; permit me to seat myself.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Uncle Billy let himself cautiously down upon the
green turf. Valeria gave her hand to India, who
stepped out upon the terrace and seated herself. Mrs. Vivian
sank down near her. Oriole placed herself
by her mistress, with the plume fan. Fly stood a
short distance off, with his basket of oranges.</p>

<p class='c005'>The tall rose-trees, blown by the breeze, shed coolness
and fragrance over the party. The beautiful variegated
lawn, with its groves, ponds, and parterres,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>stretched out before them; and below it flowed on,
between its banks of purple shadow, the limpid Pearl,
with the evening light fast fading from its white
bosom.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now, then, Mr. Bolling!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now, then, Mrs. Vivian! I said that there was an
analogy running through the universe of nature; thus,
the centripetal and centrifugal forces, that modify
each other’s power, and regulate the motions of the
planetary systems, correspond exactly to predestination
and free will”—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Do you understand him <em>now</em>, Fly?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, ma’am; Marse Billy’s too deep for me now.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And for me too, Fly; put down your basket now,
and go, Fly. I dislike to see a poor child tiring himself,
first upon one foot, and then upon the other; it
puts me ill at ease.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, go! you sickly little wretch, you! I wonder
how you think the ladies like to have such an ugly
little attenuated black shrimp as you are about them;
and I’m astonished at the gardener for presuming to
send you here. Be off with you, and never show
your face again,” said Master Billy, growing very red
in the face with zeal and gallantry.</p>

<p class='c005'>Little Fly looked first surprised and grieved, and
then penitent on the score of his sickness and deformity,
and set down his basket and turned to go.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Please don’t scold him, Mr. Bolling; it’s not his
fault, poor little fellow! It was I who asked Mr.
Sutherland to take him from the field and place him
in the garden, because it is shadier there, and the
work is lighter. Everybody cannot be strong and
handsome—can they, Fly?” And the gentle speaker
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>turned and laid her hand kindly upon the boy’s head
and smiled encouragingly in his face. The child
looked up in grateful affection; and the eyes of all
the party were raised to welcome the orphan step-daughter
of Mrs. Vivian. She was a fair, pale girl,
of a gentle, thoughtful, pensive cast of countenance
and style of beauty, with which her plain dress of deep
mourning perfectly harmonized.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Come and sit by me, Rosalie, love,” said the
widow, making room for the maiden, half embracing
her with one arm.</p>

<p class='c005'>The kind girl put an orange in the boy’s hand, and,
smiling, motioned him away; and Fly, no longer
mortified, but solaced and cheerful, ran off.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now proceed, Mr. Bolling. Rosalie, dove, Mr.
Bolling is explaining to us the two great motive
powers of the universe; the centripetal, which he says
means the law of the Lord, and the centrifugal, which
he says means the temptation of the demon. And we,
my love, are the planetary bodies, kept from extremes
of good and evil by the opposite action of these two
forces. Is not this it, Mr. Bolling?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, madam; no! no! no! Lord! Lord! Thus it
is to expose one’s theories, especially to Mrs. Vivian
there, who would wrest the plainest text of Scripture
to her own perdition. No, ma’am; I was about to say
that the overruling will of Providence and the free
agency of man were the two great motive powers of
the moral universe—the human free will, being the
great inward and impulsive force, is the centrifugal
or flying-off power, and the government of God the centripetal
or constraining power; that in the moral world
these two great forces modify each other’s action, just
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>as their prototypes do in the material world—keeping
all in healthful action. Do you understand me?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Do you understand <em>yourself</em>, Mr. Bolling?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ah, I see you don’t—women seldom do!” said
Uncle Billy, wiping his forehead. “Thus, then, were
man without free will—without the power of working
out his own salvation, or the privilege of sending
himself to perdition, if he desired it—he would no
longer be a moral agent, and, were he never so sinless,
he would be at the best only a sinless puppet, an
automaton, and God’s creation would be a dumb show.
And, on the other hand, were human free will left
without restraint of the Lord’s overruling government,
why, man would rush into all sorts of extravagances,
become a maniac, and convert God’s order into chaos
again. But, both these evil extremes being avoided,
the Scylla of inert, passive obedience is left upon the
right, and the Charybdis of unbridled license on the
left, and all goes on well and harmoniously. And now
I hope you understand how it is that in ‘binding
nature fast in fate,’ God still left free the human
will.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, I do not; it seems to me that we are free
agents, or we are <em>not</em> free agents—one or the other.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“We’re both, I assure you—both. Truth generally
lies between extremes. I have known that all my
life, and acted upon it. We <em>are</em> free agents, and we
are <em>not</em>—that is to say, we are free agents within a
certain limit, and no further. And observe, my dear
Mrs. Vivian, and my dear girls! <em>within that limit
we have still room enough to save or to lose our souls!</em>”</p>

<p class='c005'>This speech was concluded with so much solemnity
of manner, that it imposed a silence on the little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>circle, that might have lasted much longer than it did,
had Mr. Bolling been disposed to repose on his laurels.
He was not.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now, are you satisfied, madam?” he inquired of
Mrs. Vivian.</p>

<p class='c005'>The little lady shook her jetty ringlets, and slowly
picked her marabout fan to pieces.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I think mamma wishes to know why these things
need be so,” said Rosalie.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My sweet Miss Vivian, little maidens should be
seen, and not heard.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t tempt Mr. Bolling beyond his depth, Rosalie,”
smiled the widow; and <em>not</em> suiting the action to
the word, she handed Uncle Billy an orange she had
just peeled.</p>

<p class='c005'>The little gentleman received the attention with a
deprecating, humble bow, and, to prevent inconvenient
questioning, turned to Miss Sutherland, and
inquired when she had heard from her cousin Mark,
winking with what he supposed to be a killing leer.</p>

<p class='c005'>The beauty slightly raised her lip and arched her
brows, but deigned no other answer.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, she has not heard from Mr. Sutherland for
three whole days, and his last letter was but twelve
pages long. I am afraid he is fickle, like the rest. I
should not wonder if he were now the humble servant
of some northern blue ——. It is written, ‘put not
your trust in’—pantaloons. Men are so uncertain,”
said Valeria.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Men are so uncertain! What men? Uncertain
in what respect?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“All men are uncertain, in all things!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Humph, that is a totally unfounded calumny on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>our sex; though, to be candid, I acknowledge it is
but too true of all men, without a single exception—save
myself!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You? Oh, dear, oh! Ha! ha! ha! <em>You!</em>”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, me! In what did you ever find me uncertain?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“In what? Oh, heavens! he asks in what! Why,
in <em>all things</em>—mental, moral, and physical! In religion,
politics, and morality! In friendship, love, and
truth! In war, courtship, and money! In one word,
you are a thorough, essential, organic uncertainty.
Other people are uncertain—you are uncertainty.
I think, in the day of general doom, you will find
yourself—nothing in nowhere!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Uncle Billy turned away from this unmerciful
philippic, and again asked Miss Sutherland if she had
lately heard from her cousin.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have not heard from him for two weeks,” replied
the young lady, in a low voice, and without
raising her eyes.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nan, what would you give me for a letter?” inquired
Mr. Bolling, rolling his little blue eyes merrily,
as he drew one from his pocket and laid it before her.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, Mr. Bolling! have you had this letter all this
time, and detained it from me?” said the beauty, reproachfully,
as she took it, and, excusing herself,
withdrew into the house to peruse it.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Come, Rosalie, this night air is deadly to you, my
child.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, mamma, see, the full moon is just rising over
those purple hills. I only want to see it reflected in
the river, and then I will come.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Are you moon-struck, then, Rosalie? Come in;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>you can safely view the scene from the house. Besides,
coffee is about to be served.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And the lady gave her hand to her step-daughter
and assisted her to arise, and then tenderly drawing
the girl’s arm within her own, turned to lead her into
the house. And Mr. Bolling lifted himself up, and
picking up his straw hat, said—</p>

<p class='c005'>“And I must go down to the cotton-mills, and
make Clement Sutherland come home to his supper.
Heigh-ho! it’s an incontrovertible fact, that if I did
not walk after that man and take care of him, he’d
kill himself in the pursuit of gain in one month.
Everything is forgotten—mental culture and bodily
comfort. I have to bully him to his breakfast, and
dragoon him to his dinner, and scare him to his supper.
If things go on in this way, I shall have to cut
up his food and place it to his lips. He is growing
to be a monomaniac on the subject of money-getting.
He is as thin as a whipping-post, and about as enlivening
to look upon. He looks like a weasel in the
winter time, all skin and hair, and cunning and care!
He looks as if he felt poor in the midst of all his possessions,
and I suppose he really does; while here am
I, without a sous, cent, markee, happy as a king, and
much more at leisure; eating hearty, and sleeping
sound, and growing fat; ‘having nothing, yet possessing
all things,’ according to Scripture, and without
a care in life, except to keep Clement from sharing
the fate of Midas, and starving in the midst of gold.
And, by-the-by, <em>that</em> is another heathen myth, with an
eternal, awful truth wrapped up in it. Heigh-ho!.
Well, here’s to bring him home to his supper. And
a hot time I shall have of it, between him and the infernal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>machinery! I shall not get the thunder of the
mills out of my ears, or the shower of cotton-lint out
of my eyes, nose, and throat, the whole night! Oriole,
is that you? Do you go and tell the housekeeper,
child, to have something comforting prepared for your
poor master. He’s had nothing since breakfast; I
couldn’t find him at dinner-time. He was gone, devil
knows where, to inspect, devil knows what! He is
the only southerner I ever <em>did</em> know to give himself
up so entirely to the worship of Mammon, and the
only one, I hope, I ever shall know!”</p>

<p class='c005'>And, having eased his mind by this fit of grumbling,
Uncle Billy waddled off on his benevolent
errand to the mills.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the meantime Mrs. Vivian conducted her step-daughter
into the drawing-room communicating with
Miss Sutherland’s boudoir. The room was now brilliantly
lighted up, but vacant of the family. The
broad doors were slidden back into the walls, revealing
the boudoir in its rich-toned gloom and gleam of
purple and gold; and India herself, standing in the
midst, quite lost in thought, with one jewelled hand
pressing back the amber ringlets from her forehead,
and the other hanging down by her side, clasping the
letter of Mr. Sutherland. So deeply troubled and
perplexed was her look, that Valeria impulsively
sprang to her side, exclaiming, “What grieves you,
my dearest India? No evil news, I trust?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Miss Sutherland burst into tears, and silently handed
her the letter. But before Valeria had turned it about
and found the commencement, India recovered her
voice, and said in broken accents, “You know how
closely I have kept his correspondence for the last
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>few weeks. Alas! I have had reason for it, Valeria.
Little do his uncles imagine what detains him at the
North. But he conceals nothing from me, and he
lays the heavy responsibility of his confidence upon
me. For a month past it has been an onerous burden
to my conscience.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My love! what has he been doing there? Has he
killed his man in a duel, and got himself in trouble,
in that frozen stiff North, where a gentleman cannot
even shoot his rival in a generous quarrel, without
being put to the inconvenience of a judicial investigation?
I really do suppose that is it, now!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, no! Would it were only that! That were
no dishonour, at least. Oh, no! It is as much worse
as it could possibly be!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I cannot believe that Mr. Sutherland would do
aught unworthy of a man and a gentleman.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Woe to my lips that they should utter the charge.
But read his letter, Valeria, and advise me, for I am
deeply distressed,” said Miss Sutherland; and she
threw herself back into a cushioned chair, and bowed
her face upon her hands, until all the amber ringlets
drooped and veiled them.</p>

<p class='c005'>Valeria ran her eyes quickly over the letter, and
then she threw herself into a chair—but it was to
laugh. Miss Sutherland raised her head in silent surprise
and displeasure. But still Valeria laughed, till
the tears ran down her cheeks, holding up one hand
in speechless deprecation, to implore forgiveness for a
mirth impossible to restrain. When she found her
voice—“Why, my dear, unsophisticated girl, there is
nothing except a great deal of food for laughter in
all this! He has been in New York at the height of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>the annual fever, and has caught it! He has been bit
by a raging reformer, and gone rabid! Not the first
hot-headed young southerner sent to a northern college
who has fallen into the same series of fevers.
But they all come safely through it! When they
find out that to free their slaves means just to empty
their pockets, and go to work with their own hands
or brains, you have no idea how refrigerating the
effect. Don’t fear for Mr. Sutherland. He will be
brought beautifully out of it! Only note it! he will
never send a son of his to be educated at a northern
college. Come, cheer up, my love, and never mind
my laughing. Really it is legitimate food for laughter!
Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, don’t! Only think of it, even at its best!
Here, for weeks past, he has been mingling freely with
these sort of persons—mixing in their assemblies,
where people of all colours and castes meet on equal
terms, in a stifling crowd—oh, Queen of Heaven! it
is a ruinous dishonour—an unspeakable insult he has
cast upon me, his betrothed!” she exclaimed, rising
with all the proud and passionate energy of deep and
strong conviction.</p>

<p class='c005'>And again Mrs. Vivian gave way to a peal of
silvery laughter, exclaiming, “Why, you simple
maiden! gentlemen <em>will</em> do such odd things, because
you see they (poets excepted) have no instincts—not
even any original ideas of refinement. But be comforted!
He comes to us by sea, and will have passed
through several hundred miles of salt sea wind before
he reaches your fragrant boudoir.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“<em>Do not</em> pursue this subject! <em>Do not</em>, Valeria! <em>Do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>not</em> press it upon me so! It wrongs, it injures me—I
feel it does!” said India, with energetic earnestness.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I never saw you so deeply and strongly moved
before—nonsense! But indeed I must have my laugh
out with somebody! It is, besides, too good to keep—this
ludicrous secret! Ah, here comes Mr. Bolling,
with Uncle Clement in his wake, no doubt, for he
went to fetch him! I must tell Uncle Clement of his
son-in-law’s conversation or—die.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Uncle, Uncle Clement! what do you think has
happened to Mark? Listen,” exclaimed the vivacious
lady, running off with the letter. Miss Sutherland
sprang and caught her hand, and, pale as death, cried
out, “On your <em>life</em>, Valeria—on your soul! You do
not know my father; he abhors those sects with an
exterminating fury of hatred! Give me the letter!
Nay, now by your <em>honour</em>, Valeria! It was a sacred
confidence. Give me the letter!” and she wrested
the contended paper away from the giddy, laughing,
little lady.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hey<em>day</em>! What the mischief is all this? A regular
romp or wrestle? Let me put down my hat,
and I’ll stand by and see fair play,” exclaimed Mr.
Bolling, who had just entered.</p>

<p class='c005'>Blushing with anger at having suffered herself to
be surprised out of her usual repose of manner, Miss
Sutherland sat down in silent dignity, while Mrs.
Vivian, still laughing, inquired, “Where is uncle?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Where? Yes! ‘Echo answers where?’ He has
not been home to breakfast nor dinner, and now I
suppose he’ll not be here to supper. I went down to
the mill to bring him home to supper; he was not
there! Guess where he was? Gone over the other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>side of the river, to preside at the lynching of an incendiary.
Upon my sacred word and honour!” exclaimed
Uncle Billy, growing crimson in the face,
“the most cruel, unjust, unwarrantable proceeding I
ever heard of in all my life; <em>though</em>, to be perfectly
fair, I must say it serves the fellow exactly right.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“<em>Apropos—what did I tell you, Valeria?</em>” said Miss
Sutherland, in a low voice.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And, now, what is this mighty mystery that must
be concealed from Clement?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mrs. Vivian and Miss Sutherland exchanged glances,
and the latter replied: “It is a letter from Mr. Sutherland,
sir, that concerns myself alone, and I do not
choose to make its contents public, even at the suggestion
of my dear esteemed friend here.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ah! Umph—hum! Yes! But now, my dear
child, let me say one word. Young people are foolish,
and need to be counselled by the wisdom of age.
Observe, therefore, what I say, and be guided by my
advice. There is no circumstance or combination of
circumstances whatever, that will justify you in withholding
any secret from your father; nevertheless, I
am bound to say that nothing under the sun could
excuse you in betraying, even to him, the confidence
of your betrothed husband. Now, I hope you understand
your duty! At least, you have my advice!”
said Uncle Billy, wiping his head, after which he
placed his handkerchief in his straw hat, seated himself,
and put the hat upon the carpet between his feet—all
with a look of great self-satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c005'>“At least the advice is very practical!” said an
ironical voice behind him. All turned to see Mr.
Sutherland the elder, who had silently entered. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>was of an unusually tall, attenuated form, with a
yellow, bilious, cadaverous face, whetted to the keenest
edge by care and rapacity, and surrounded by
hair and whiskers so long and bristling as to give
quite a ferocious aspect to a set of features that without
them would have looked merely cunning. He
strode into the midst of the circle, and standing before
his daughter, demanded in an authoritative tone,
“Give me that letter, Miss Sutherland!” She turned
deadly pale, but without an instant’s hesitation arose
to her feet, placed the letter in her bosom, and stood
fronting him.</p>

<p class='c005'>Seeing that the matter was about to take a very
serious turn, Mrs. Vivian playfully interfered, by
nestling her soft little hand into the great bony one
of the planter, and saying, with her bewitching smile,
“Ah, then, Mr. Sutherland, let young people alone.
Do not rifle a young girl’s little mysteries. Remember
when you were youthful—it was not so long ago
but what you can remember, I am sure,” she said with
an arch glance. “And when you used to write sweet
nonsense to one beautiful Cecile, her mother, how
would you have liked it if the practical commercial
eyes of good Monsieur Dumoulins had read your
letters? Come! give me your arm to supper; we
have waited for you half an hour;” and the lively
lady slipped her arm into his; and Mr. Sutherland
with the very ill grace of a bear led captive, suffered
himself to be carried off. Mr. Billy Bolling, with a
flourishing bow, gave his hand to Miss Sutherland,
and Paul Sutherland led Rosalie.</p>

<p class='c005'>The apartment was very pleasant. The inner shutters
of wire gauze, that were closed against the mosquitoes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>did not exclude the fresh and fragrant evening
breeze that fanned the room. The elegant tea-table
stood in the midst, and the whole was illumined by
light subdued through shades of ground glass—not
figured—but plain, and diffusing a soft, clear, even
radiance. They sat down to the table, and coffee and
tea were served by waiters from the sideboard. To
dispel the last shades of suspicion and discontent from
the mind of Mr. Sutherland, Mrs. Vivian remarked:
“We are to have Mr. Mark Sutherland home in a very few
days, if I understand aright. <i><span lang="fr">N’est ce pas, chere Indie?</span></i>”
Miss Sutherland only bowed, and the conversation
turned upon their approaching voyage to Europe.</p>

      <div class='line'>On her cheek the autumn flush</div>

      <div class='line'>In the midst of brown was born,</div>
      <div class='line'>Like red poppies grown with corn.</div>
      <div class='line'>Round her eyes her tresses lay—</div>
      <div class='line'>Which are blackest, none can say;</div>
      <div class='line'>But long lashes veil a light</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>On the opposite side of the Pearl from Cashmere,
and a little further down the river, and back from its
banks, in a small vale embosomed in hills, was Silentshades,
the home of Mark Sutherland. The homestead
was the same that had been built by his father, upon
first laying out the plantation. The house was very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>modest and unpretending—a moderate-sized, oblong
building of two stories, painted light brown, with
green shutters, and with piazzas surrounding both
floors. The house was shaded and darkened by catalpa
trees clustering thick about it and overhanging the
roof. The pillars of the piazzas were thickly twined
with running vines, that, branching and interlacing,
formed a beautiful <em>treillage</em> of foliage and flowers.
Doors from this piazza admitted directly into the
rooms upon the first floor. In the right-hand front
room, opening upon two sides into the piazza, upon
the next evening after the events related in the last
chapter, sat Mrs. Sutherland. She was a medium-sized,
full-formed brunette, of perhaps forty years of
age; yet so perfect was her physical organization, and
so well regulated her moral nature, so even, calm,
and blameless had been the tenor of her life, that now,
she was a specimen—not, certainly, of youthful beauty—but
of a rarer kind of matured and perfected matronly
beauty. Her style was noble and simple. Her rich,
abundant hair of glossy black, with purplish light, was
plainly divided above a broad forehead, and laying down
upon the temples in heavy looped bands, was carried behind
and twisted into a thick, rich coil, and wound round
and round into a large knot fastened with pins; there
were no combs, curls, ribbons, or fripperies of any sort,
to mar the simple, grand beauty of the head. The eyebrows
were black and lightly arched; the eyes large,
dark, and very quiet, under their curtain of long black
lashes; the nose perfectly straight; and the cheeks,
lips, and chin, perfectly beautiful in contour. Her
complexion was of that mellow, Italian brown, flushing
and deepening in the cheeks to a carnation richness.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>(Uncle Billy, who sincerely admired his sister, always
said that her complexion ever reminded him of the
bloom on a ripe, luscious peach.) Her dress was very
simple—a black silk with a delicate lace collar pinned
with a small diamond brooch. She sat in an easy
chair, reading a letter; and as she read and turned
the leaves a quiet smile would just dawn and play on
her lips. By her side was a stand with an open book,
a workbox, and a little silver hand-bell. At last,
without removing her eyes from the letter, she
smilingly extended her hand, and rang the little bell.
A servant entered, and still without withdrawing her
eyes from the fascinating letter, she said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Send Mrs. Jolly to me, William.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The man withdrew with a bow, and the housekeeper
entered, and awaited the commands of the
lady.</p>

<p class='c005'>Slowly and smilingly folding up the letter, she said,
“Mr. Sutherland is coming home this evening. He
brings a friend, a young gentleman, with him. I wish
you to have their chambers prepared; and do remember
to close the wire-gauze blinds, and burn catalpa
leaves in the rooms, to destroy any mosquitoes that
may remain.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And at what time shall I order supper, madam?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ah, yes—it will be necessary to put it back two
or three hours. You must judge of that. Mr. Sutherland
may arrive at any time between this and ten
o’clock.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The housekeeper left the room, and the lady sank
into her chair again, to re-peruse her letter, smiling
and murmuring to herself, half aloud—“Dear boy!
dearest Mark! Sure no mother ever had a son like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>mine. Comes to <em>me</em> first—comes to <em>me</em> before hastening
to see his lady-love—his adored India. Dearest
Mark—but his devotion shall be rewarded. He shall
find his India here.” And she went to a writing-desk,
took paper, and pen, and ink, and wrote the following
note:</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Silentshades</span>, <em>June</em>, 184–.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Dear India</span>: My dear niece, but dearer daughter,
just get into your carriage, and come to me, and do
not pause to wonder why I ask you. It is late, I
know, but the moon shines brightly, and the roads
are good—your driver is careful, and the distance is
short. More than all, dear daughter, I consider your
coming very important. So hasten, darling, to</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Your affectionate aunt and mother,</div>
      <div class='line in20'><span class='sc'>Helen B. Sutherland</span>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Having sealed this letter, the lady rang the bell and
gave it in charge of a footman, urging dispatch.</p>

<p class='c005'>Soon a waiter entered, and lighted up the rooms;
and he had scarcely closed the blinds and withdrawn,
before the sound of carriage-wheels was heard approaching,
and the lady hastened out into the hall.
The carriage paused before the door, and in an instant
after, Mark Sutherland had alighted, and was clasped
to the bosom of his mother.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, my dear Mark! I am so overjoyed to have
you again!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dear mother, I am so proud and happy to find
you looking so well! Permit me to present my
friend—Mr. Lincoln Lauderdale—Mrs. Sutherland.”</p>

<p class='c005'>A low bow from the gentleman, and a deep courtesy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>from the lady, and then smilingly throwing off her
habitual reserve, Mrs. Sutherland offered her hand,
saying—</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am very glad to see you, Mr. Lauderdale. You
are not a stranger, I assure you. My son has taught
me to esteem you, and desire your friendship. Will
you enter now?”</p>

<p class='c005'>And with another smile she gave her hand to her
guest, and permitted him to lead her into the drawing-room.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Sutherland remained in the hall to give some
directions to the grooms, and to order the baggage
of his guest to be taken up to his chamber. After
which he entered the parlour, and laying his hand
affectionately upon his friend’s shoulder, said—</p>

<p class='c005'>“My dear Lauderdale, when you feel disposed—or,
rather, <em>if</em> you feel disposed—to change your
dress—Flamingo will show you your apartment.
Supper will be ready—Madame, when will supper be
ready?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My dear Mark, any time—in an hour—an hour
and a half”——</p>

<p class='c005'>“In an hour, Lincoln; that will give you ample
time. Flame! lights here. Show Mr. Lauderdale to
his room, and consider yourself in his exclusive service
while he honours us with his company. I presume
you will prefer Flame, my dear Lincoln, because
you already know the fellow.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Thank you, but really I do not need”——</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, say not a word, my dear boy! When you
have been subjected to the enervating influence of
this climate for a week, you will better know what
you need.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>By this time Flamingo made his appearance with
chamber lamps. Lauderdale arose to follow him.
Sutherland accompanied him into the hall.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My dear Mark,” said the former, “did I understand
you to say that Mrs. Sutherland was your <em>own</em>
mother?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Undoubtedly my own mother! What a question!
Besides, my friend, pardon me! but really, where
are your eyes? We are said to be the image of each
other!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, now, although both of you are dark, with
high complexions, I cannot see the likeness, to save
my soul,” said Lauderdale, mischievously; then adding,
“she is very handsome.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“<em>Is she not!</em>” echoed Sutherland, with enthusiasm,
and accompanying Lauderdale up stairs—“the handsomest
woman in the world? oh, except <em>one</em>. You
should see India. And, more than that, she—my
mother, I mean—is the most excellent, except—<em>none</em>.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I cannot think that she was so handsome in early
youth as she is now.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, I suppose her youth to her maturity was as
the budding to the blooming rose—that is all. Here
is your room. Make Flame supply you with anything
you may need, that is not at hand; and for your life—nay,
<em>more</em>, for your good looks, worth more than life—do
not open the wire shutters; if you do, you may
look in the glass in ten minutes after, and fancy yourself
ill with the erysipelas. <i><span lang="fr">Au revoir!</span></i> When you are
ready, come down.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mark Sutherland left the room, and instead of seeking
his own chamber, to refresh himself with a change
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>of raiment, he hastened down the stairs, entered the
parlour, and once more clasped his mother fervently
in his arms, and—</p>

<p class='c005'>“My dearest mother,” and “My dearest Mark,” were
the words exchanged between them. “But, oh, Mark!
how haggard you look, my love! You have been ill,
and never let me know it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, upon my honour, mother!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ah, but you are so pale and thin, and your expression
is so anxious—what is it? What can it be,
Mark?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My own dear mother, it is nothing that should
give you any uneasiness. I have had a long, fatiguing
ride, and—I have not heard from India for more than
a week. How is my Pearl?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ah, rogue! a lover’s anxiety. Is that the cause
of those haggard looks? And yet, to come to me
first! Dear Mark! But I have anticipated all your
wishes. Your India will be here to meet you—I am
expecting her every moment. Hark! there are her
carriage-wheels!” said the lady, going to the window;
then hurrying back, she exclaimed, “<i><span lang="fr">Peste!</span></i> she has
some one with her—that lively little Mrs. Vivian, I
suppose. Listen, Mark! I will carry her off to a
dressing-room, and leave you to meet India. She does
not know that you are here.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And Mrs. Sutherland went to the hall door, which
she reached just as Mrs. Vivian, who was the first to
alight, entered.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ah, how do you do, Mrs. Vivian? I am very
glad to see you! Come, come into my room.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, but stop—let us wait for India!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“By no means, my dear. <em>Mark</em> will wait for her.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>“<em>A-h-h-h!</em> <em>He</em> has come!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Certainly,” said the lady, carrying off her captive.</p>

<p class='c005'>India sauntered languidly up the door-stairs. Mark
sprang forward to meet her. She started—paled—reeled—might
have fallen, but he caught her to his
bosom, murmuring deeply, earnestly, “<em>India! my
India!</em>”</p>

<p class='c005'>For a moment she had nearly swooned with surprise
and joy, but in the next instant she recovered,
and deeply blushing, withdrew herself from him, saying,
“I did not know that you were here.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have only this instant arrived,” he replied.
“My dear, beautiful India! to see you, it is unspeakable
happiness.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And he would have clasped her form again, but
with flushed cheek she glided out of his arms and
entered the parlour. He followed her, placed an easy
chair, seated her on it, rolled a cushion to her feet,
untied and removed her bonnet, lifted the mass of
shining amber ringlets and pressed them to his face,
and then would have sunk down upon the cushion at
her feet—there to sit and worship with his eyes her
peerless beauty, only the sound of light footsteps and
silvery laughter arrested the folly.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was Valeria, who, chatting and laughing with
her usual gaiety, entered, accompanied by Mrs. Sutherland.
Their entrance was soon followed by that of
Mr. Lauderdale, who was immediately presented to
Mrs. Vivian and Miss Sutherland.</p>

<p class='c005'>Supper was next announced, and the party left the
drawing-room. After supper, the evening was spent
in music, conversation, and cards. A storm arising,
detained the ladies all night. After the party had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>separated, each to seek his or her own apartment,
Sutherland stopped for an instant in Lauderdale’s
room to ask, “Well, what do you think of her, Lincoln?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“She is perfectly beautiful.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Is she not?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“There is positively nothing possible to be added
to her beauty!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ah, did I not tell you so?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“She has taken me completely captive.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The deuce! I did not require you to be taken
captive.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“If I were only in a condition to seek the lady’s
love—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Humph! What would you do, then?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Lose no time in suing for it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The demon you wouldn’t! That is extremely cool,
upon my sacred word and honour!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Such glorious black eyes!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“They are not black, mine honest friend, but blue—celestial
blue.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Blue, are they? I thought they were black; but,
in truth, one cannot follow their quickly-changing
light and shade to find the hue, they scintillate and
flash so.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Scintillate and flash! Why, they are calm and
steady as stars. What the deuce are her eyes to
you?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And then her magnificent black hair!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Black! you are mad! Hers is bronze in the shade,
and golden in the sunlight. D——l fly away with
you!” the latter clause under his breath.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I swear her hair is superb black!”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>“Who are you talking about?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Who—who but charming Mrs. Vivian!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Cousin Valeria! Oh-h-h-h! ha! ha! ha! And <em>I</em>
was speaking of India! So you think Mrs. Vivian
good-looking?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Good-looking—divine.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I thought no one in his senses could apply that
term to any woman but Miss Sutherland.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Who—the red-haired young lady?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“<em>Red-haired!</em>” burst out the voice of Sutherland,
in indignant astonishment; then reining in his anger
with a strong hand, he added, “Lincoln, you are my
friend, but there are some provocations”—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Miss Sutherland is <em>graceful</em>,” said Lauderdale, with
a quiet smile.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Tah-tah-tah, with your faint praises; good night.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now, here is a reasonable man! When he thought
me praising his love with great fervour, he was so
jealous as to feel like running me through the heart;
and now that he finds me very moderate in my admiration
of his idol, he is angry enough to sweep my
head off at a blow,” said Lauderdale, laughing.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Good night!” said Sutherland, to cover his confusion.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Stay, I can’t let you go so; your lady-love is
<em>really</em> lovely enough to turn all the heads and break
all the hearts that approach her. But she has not
disturbed the healthful action of mine—will that content
you?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, because I know it is true—especially the first
part of it. Good night.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Good night.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And the friends separated.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>“And is this <em>all</em> you have to say in support of your
project, Mark?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not all, my dear mother.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The lady applied her handkerchief to her eyes
quietly, almost stealthily; her face was pale and
sorrowful; she seemed to restrain herself steadily, as
though she thought the betrayal of strong emotion
unbecoming to a woman of her age and station. Her
son had just revealed to her his purpose of emancipating
all the negroes upon his plantation and sending
them to Liberia, with his reasons for so doing. The
scene took place very early in the morning after his
arrival. It was in her dressing-room. Before any of
their guests had arisen, they were up, and she had
called him, as he passed her door. They sat now at
the open window that looked out upon the beautiful
valley of the Pearl, with its groves and fields and
streams all fresh and resplendent in the light of the
newly-risen sun. The mother sighed deeply as she
withdrew her glance from the gladdening scene, and
fixed it upon the face of her son.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And so, Mark, this is the cause of your ill and
anxious looks?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, mother; I will not deny to you that it has
cost me a very severe struggle; and perhaps you see
some of its effects.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, <em>some</em> of them, Mark—alas! not <em>all</em>,” said the
lady, in a low, faint voice.</p>

<p class='c005'>If a little while before she had restrained unmeet
energy of expression in the strong emotion she had
felt, now all power as well as all will seemed to forsake
her. She sat silent, with her hands folded and her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>eyes fixed upon them. Mr. Sutherland watched her
anxiously.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My dear madam, I have pained you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am a widow, Mark, and have no child but you”—</p>

<p class='c005'>“<em>Mother</em>”——</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is a sorrowful time for the mother, Mark, when
the boy she has nursed and brought up to man’s estate
turns upon her in her weakness, arrayed in all the
strength and power of manhood.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My dearest <em>mother</em>”——</p>

<p class='c005'>“Your father, Mark, never caused me a tear or a
sigh in his life.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“God bless his memory for that.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“He trusted so in your affection for me, Mark—<em>and
so did I</em>—that he left me totally dependent upon
you”——</p>

<p class='c005'>“My dearest mother, your comfort and convenience
shall be my first object in life. Not even India, my
loved India, shall cause me to forget all I owe to you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Words, Mark! words! This project of yours will
reduce me to beggary!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, dear madam, it shall not. Me it will reduce
to—my own exertions for a livelihood, but not you.
When all my slaves are freed, and on their way to
Africa at my cost, there will still remain, from the
sale of the land, some thirty thousand dollars. That
money, mother, with the homestead here, I intend to
settle upon yourself”——</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, my son! you break my heart. Do you think,
then, that I will suffer you to beggar yourself to enrich
me? No, dear Mark; no! Since you do not
forget me—since you remember me with affectionate
interest, it is sufficient. If I reproached you just now,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>it was only because I felt as if you did not care for
me; and that is a sorrowful feeling in a parent, Mark.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I never for one instant forgot your interests, dear
mother. How could I? I had settled the plan I
have named to you, in my mind, before I left the
North.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I cannot bear the name of that quarter of our
country! the word strikes like a bullet, Mark!” exclaimed
the lady, with an impulsive start, and shrunk
as if indeed she were shot.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Sutherland looked down, mortified and troubled.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And as for this plan, Mark,” proceeded the lady,
“it must not be carried out. Under no circumstances
can I consent that you beggar yourself for me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dearest mother, I do not think it possible for mere
loss of fortune to beggar a man of good health and
good morals. I shall go to the West. It is a broad
field for enterprise. I studied law for my amusement,
having had a strong natural attraction for it. I shall
commence the practice of that profession in some
western village, and grow up with the town. I shall
succeed. Indeed, methinks new life and energy runs
through my veins and fires my heart at the very
thought of difficulties to meet and overcome!” said
Mr. Sutherland, smiling gaily, stretching his arms and
rubbing his hands together.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Alas! you do not know what you are talking
about, Mark! What a project! And your approaching
marriage with India—is it possible in this connexion
that you do not think of that?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not think of that!” echoed Mr. Sutherland, as a
strange, beautiful smile flitted over his face. “Mother,
I dreaded this interview with you; but I looked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>forward to an explanation with my loved India as the
first reward of right-doing—if what I have done is
right—a foretaste of what the rewards of Heaven will
be! My India! I know her generosity, her magnanimity,
her high-souled enthusiasm! How many
times I have experienced it! How many times, when
reading with her of some high heroism of the olden
time, when there were heroes, have I seen her pause,
her bosom heave, her cheek flush, her eye kindle and
gaze upon me, expressing unspeakable admiration of
those lofty deeds! And now, when in her own life
an opportunity occurs of practising those very same
great virtues—when she has the power, by sacrificing
wealth and luxury, to bless hundreds of her fellow-beings,
and not them only, but their children and
children’s children—do I not know that high-souled
girl will aspire to do it! Madam, it is a majestic, a
godlike power, to be able to confer the blessing of
liberty and education upon hundreds of beings and
their descendants to numberless generations—a power
I would not <em>now</em> exchange for a small limited monarchy.
And, oh! do I not know that my India—soul
of my soul!—will think as I do—will feel as I
do? Nay, do I not know that she will go beyond
me? Mother, when I have doubted, or struggled
against my better feelings, I have seen as in a vision,
her eyes suffused with generous tears, her cheek kindle,
and felt the warm pressure of her hand encouraging,
inspiring me!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, Mark! Mark! romance! nothing more. And
even should India approve your project, which I think
quite impossible, what is your further purpose? To
leave her here, bound by an engagement, to wear out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>her youth in expectation of your making a fortune
and coming back to claim her hand?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, dearest mother, that were too hard a trial to
both of us. No, I mean to take her with me to the
West, to encourage and assist me while I make her
as happy as I possibly can!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Here, again, the lady’s feelings arose to so high a
pitch of excitement that she had to put a violent constraint
upon herself, while she answered quietly,
“And how do you think Miss Sutherland will like to
lay aside all the prestige of her rank, and wealth, and
bridehood, and, instead of a splendid wedding, and a
bridal tour, and a voyage to Europe, take an ignominious
departure from her father’s house, for a life of
poverty and privation in the West?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I told you, dearest mother, that my India was of
a highly heroic nature. That does not mean wedded
to ease and worldly honour; indeed, it more frequently
means the loss of both.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And so you deliberately mean to take that girl—if
she will go with you—to some miserable western
village, to endure all the miseries of poverty?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What miseries of poverty, dearest mother? If
you were a European talking of Europeans, I could
understand your prudence; but you are an American
matron talking to an American youth, and advising
him not to marry the girl he loves if he has not a fortune
to support her. It seems to me, mother, that in
<em>our</em> country the man or woman who refuses to marry
for such a reason, wants faith, love, hope, enterprise,
energy, and every thing they ought to have; and
under such circumstances, it seems but right, indeed,
that they should stay single.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>“You do not know what you are talking about.
But should India be so imprudent, do you think her
father will consent to such a mad project?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“His consent to our union was long ago obtained;
and if, under present circumstances, he should withdraw
it—India is of age, you know!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mark, tell me if you have ever had any experimental
knowledge of <em>want</em>?” The young man looked
up with a questioning glance. “Because if you do
not know, I can tell you, Mark. I know how young
people think of poverty, and talk of poverty, when
any strong motive like love, or any other passion,
urges them to embrace it; and people who are older,
and should know better, talk pretty much in the
same way. They will tell you that poverty deprives
you of none of the real essential blessings of life; that
the riches of nature and of nature’s God are free alike
to the rich and the poor; that the blessings of health,
of well-doing, of sunshine, and the face of nature, are
open alike to both. It is so with the rich, doubtless,
and it may be so with the poor who were born in this
poverty; but to the well-born and well-educated, to
the refined and intellectual, poverty is a dreadful,
dreadful thing. It is not only to suffer the privation
of proper and sufficient food, and comfortable clothing,
and dwelling—it is to be shut out of all enjoyment
of the blessings of nature and of society, and at the
same time be exposed to all the evils that nature and
society can inflict upon you. You have no leisure, or
if you have, you have no respectable clothing, in
which to go out and take the air, and enjoy the genial
sunshine of pleasant days, on the one hand; and on
the other, no adequate protection against the freezing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>cold of winter, and no escape from the burning heat
of summer. And for society, pride will not permit
you to seek the company of your sometime peers, and
delicacy restrains you from the coarse association
around you. To us, Mark, poverty would be the privation
of every enjoyment. To be poor, were to be
maimed, blind, ill, and imprisoned, at once!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dear mother, <em>you</em> are a lady—<em>I</em>, a man! And loss
of fortune has now no terrors for me; and birth and
education, so far from rendering me more helpless,
shall make me stronger to conquer my difficulties. I
have no fear of wanting any of the comforts of life
from the very onset. And as for being shut out, or
rather shut <em>in</em>, from nature—mother, do you think I
shall be? Do you think I shall keep away from
nature because I cannot call on her in a coach, with
a groom on horseback to take in my card? No, indeed.
On the contrary, I purpose to live with nature.
She’s an old intimate friend of mine, and no summer
friend either—nor shall I be a summer friend of hers,
and shrink from her boisterous winds and rattling
sleet. And as for society, mother—oh, let me quote
to you the words of Dr. Channing, whose lips, indeed,
seemed touched with fire: ‘No matter though the
prosperous of my own time will not enter my obscure
dwelling. If the Sacred Writers will enter and take
up their abode under my roof, if Milton will cross my
threshold to sing to me of paradise, and Shakspeare
to open to me the worlds of imagination and the
workings of the human heart, and Franklin to enrich
me with his practical wisdom, I shall not pine for
want of intellectual companionship.’ So, dearest
mother, with industry that will procure me all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>necessaries of life, health that will enable me to enjoy
or endure nature in all her moods, and a mind dependent
on itself for its enjoyment, what have I to
dread from loss of fortune?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It may be very well for <em>you</em>, at least tolerable; but
for <em>India</em>! You would not bring Miss Sutherland
down to such a state?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mark paused, and then answered—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, mother, yes; if the only other alternative is
to be a separation of many years, I would bring India
down to this state.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, Mark! that is very, very selfish!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I do not think so, madam.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mark! Just now, when I told you of the nameless
miseries of the well-born poor, you did not deny
them, but said, ‘Mother, <em>you</em> are a lady—<em>I</em>, a man.’
Mark! out of your own mouth I will condemn you.
India—Miss Sutherland—‘is a <em>lady</em>,’ Mark! Are you
not selfish?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, mother! not if India feels as I do—as I know
she does; not if our separation would be to her, as it
would be to me, a greater evil than all the early
struggles our union may bring upon us.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My dear son, your sanguine confidence gives me
deep pain. Dear Mark, be not too sure! Not for
worlds would I speak a word against your India.
Nor do I know that, under her circumstances, I speak
much evil of her when I say that she is haughty, self-willed,
indolent, and fastidious! But are those the
elements of self-sacrifice?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mother, I would not hear another soul breathe
aught against India but you; but to answer your
question—and granting, what I am unwilling to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>grant, that these faults of her station may be also hers—affection
will conquer them! My <em>life</em> upon India’s
magnanimity!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Yet, even while he spoke, he became suddenly pale
and aghast, as if, for the first time, the possibility that
it might be otherwise had struck him.</p>

<p class='c005'>The lady had been pale and disturbed throughout
the interview; and now she rose, and taking his hand,
said—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mark, they have gone down to breakfast; we
must go too. We will speak of this again. Mark, I
should be in despair, if I did not hope that circumstances
will compel you to abandon this insane
purpose. When do you break it to India?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“This day, mother! You have conjured up a
phantom whose presence I would not endure for many
hours. It must be exorcised by dear India forthwith.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mrs. Sutherland had two grounds of hope. The
first was, that her son, restored to home associations
and influences, might change his views and purposes
before they should become known to his uncle. Upon
this first hope she founded her purpose of preventing,
as long as possible, Mark’s intended communication
to India. The second ground of hope was, that in the
event of Mr. Sutherland’s intentions becoming known,
the powerful motives that would be brought to bear
upon him—the threatened loss of his uncle’s favour,
and of his promised bride’s hand—might irresistibly
impel him to renounce his project.</p>

<p class='c005'>But her present wish was to arrest the disclosure
of her son’s resolution until she could gain time to
use her influence upon him to induce him to abandon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>them. These thoughts did not arise in her mind during
her interview with Mark, nor until she sat reflecting
upon it, after breakfast, in the back parlour. Her
visitors, on leaving the table, had retired into the front
room.</p>

<p class='c005'>Her fit of deep thought was interrupted by the
entrance of Mrs. Vivian from that front parlour. The
“lady gay” came in, trilling a lively opera air. Mrs.
Sutherland arose, and took her hand with a very
serious manner, saying—</p>

<p class='c005'>“My dear Valeria, who have you left in the other
room?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mark and India,” answered the little widow,
raising her eyebrows with slight surprise.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No one else?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No—yes—I do not know; I believe there is a
waiter, or”—</p>

<p class='c005'>“My dearest Valeria,” said Mrs. Sutherland, drawing
her to the opposite extremity of the room, “do
me a favour; return to the room, and, not only while
you remain here, but after you go back to Cashmere,
prevent as long as possible any private conversation
between those two young people; interrupt them;
follow them; stay with them: circumvent them in
every way.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Helen, you astonish me! <em>Me</em> play Madame Detrop,
not ‘for one night only,’ but for a whole season!
You positively shock me!” exclaimed Mrs. Vivian,
and her <em>eyes</em> asked, what <em>can</em> you mean?</p>

<p class='c005'>Mrs. Sutherland answered both words and looks
at the same time, by saying, very gravely,—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Valeria, I ask a very strange favour, and impose
upon your friendship the unpleasant alternative of refusing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>me point blank, or taking upon yourself a most
ungracious duty; but, dear Valeria, in this at least
the end will justify the means. I do not wish to
separate my son and niece, as your eyes seem to say,
but <i><span lang="fr">au contraire</span></i>, to prevent their separation.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I do not comprehend.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I wish to prevent a quarrel. Young people will
not quarrel before others, any more than they will
make love before them. There is a point of controversy
between Mark and India, and I do not wish
them to have an opportunity of discussing it until
both their heads are cool.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ah, I think I know the point of contention,”
said Valeria, with a bright look of sudden intelligence.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And the thoughtless little lady, totally forgetful
that the communication had been confidential, imparted
to her the contents of Mark’s letter to India,
and the indignation she had expressed at its contents,
and the fear she had betrayed lest her father
and uncle should discover her lover’s change of sentiments.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mrs. Sutherland heard the story with a thoughtful
brow, and at its close, said—</p>

<p class='c005'>“And do you not think, Valeria, that the discussion
of this subject between them at present would end
fatally for our hopes?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I do not know, indeed. I cannot estimate the
strength of Mr. Sutherland’s convictions and purposes.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>“But you think that India will never yield to
them?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Never!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And so think I. Yet Mark, dear, deluded child,
would stake his soul on what he calls her heroism.
Well, Valeria, now will you promise me to prevent
an interview as long as you can, to give me an opportunity
of trying to bring that poor boy to reason?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ha! ha! ha! It is a thankless task, but I will
undertake it. But you must give me an assistant, to
relieve me sometimes, and to better insure the success
of your enterprise. Confide in Uncle Billy, and let
him be on duty while I am off.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I intend to have a talk with my brother upon the
subject, but in the mean time I rely mainly upon you.
Promise me again that you will be vigilant.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“As vigilant as I can, Helen; but you know my
first duty is to Rosalie, dear child! I reproach myself
for having left her last night, but the housekeeper
promised that she would sleep in the adjoining room,
and watch over her.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Do you not think that you watch over her too
much? Do you not see that she is made too much
of a hothouse plant?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Rosalie? What! when even a slight change in
the weather, or a draught of air, or a piece of fruit not
ripe, or a little too ripe, or some such trifle, is sufficient
to make her ill for a week, and to bring her to the
brink of the grave? I would give half my fortune to
any physician who would”—</p>

<p class='c005'>The little lady’s voice broke down, and her sparkling
eyes melted into tears; then she said, in a faltering
tone—</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>“Do you think she will die? or do you think
there is a blessed possibility of her health being restored?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That which she never possessed, and therefore
never lost, cannot, of course, be <em>restored</em>. But I think
a different manner of treatment would strengthen the
child; for how can you expect her to be strong,
confined to hot rooms, and idleness, and super-dainty
diet?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am sure I do the very best I can for the dear
girl; I take her out twice a day in the carriage; I
never suffer her to go alone; she never has a bath
until I dip the thermometer into it with my own
hands, to regulate the temperature; she never puts
on an article of clothing until I have ascertained it to
be well aired; and she never even eats an orange until
it has first passed through my fingers; and yet, with
all my care, she droops and droops”—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Like an over-nursed exotic. But, dear Valeria,
there! There goes Thomas, with a vase of yesterday’s
flowers, to change them. Hasten in there, dear Valeria,
and prevent an eclaircissement, while I speak to my
brother.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why, is <em>he</em> here?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Certainly; he came while we were at breakfast,
and went up stairs to change his dress. That is the
reason I remained in this room, to give him his
breakfast.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The flighty little lady, already oblivious of her
causes for distress, went singing into the room, just
in time to overhear, with her quick ears, Mr. Sutherland
say to his betrothed—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dear India—(Oh, heavens! here comes that widow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>again!)—but I <em>must</em> have an uninterrupted talk with
you; when and where shall it be?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“In the library, at twelve. Hush! She’s here”——</p>

<p class='c005'>“So,” thought Mrs. Vivian, “I have just got in time
enough to hear for myself that my efforts to be useful
and impertinent will be totally fruitless.”</p>

<hr class='c018'>

<p class='c005'>In the meanwhile Uncle Billy had changed his
dress, and had come down in a jacket and trousers of
linen, white as “driven snow,” and took his seat at
the breakfast table. While she waited upon him, Mrs.
Sutherland cautiously communicated the news that so
burdened her mind. Gradually, as she proceeded, the
truth burst with the suddenness of a thunderbolt upon
Uncle Billy, who dropped his roll and cup of coffee,
turned pale, fell back in his chair, and gasped—“Good
gracious!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t make a noise, brother, if you please. See,
James is coming with your eggs; wait until he has
withdrawn,” said the self-possessed Mrs. Sutherland;
and then she directed the servant who came in to set
down his salver, and leave the room. When he had
gone, she turned again to her brother, and said—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, this is true, and nothing remains now but to
try to overrule his purpose, or at least to gain time.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I—I am overwhelmed, prostrated, stunned with
astonishment; though, to be sure, at my time of life,
I am never the least surprised by any thing that happens.
They are fools who at fifty wonder at any
thing.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mrs. Sutherland then expressed a wish that her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>brother would aid her designs, both by delaying the
opportunity of an explanation between the young
people, and also by using all his logical powers upon
her son, to convert him from his purpose; for, strange
as it may seem, Mrs. Sutherland had unbounded faith
in Mr. Bolling’s polemic abilities. His <i><span lang="fr">soi-disant</span></i> impartiality,
coolness, and precision of judgment, had
really imposed upon her.</p>

<p class='c005'>Uncle Billy dug both his hands in his pockets, and
dropped his rosy chin upon his chest with an attitude
and expression of deep cogitation, and his face quite
flushed with the heat and burden of his thoughts.
At last he said, with an air of great deliberation—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hem! In the first place, we must essay every
possible means of persuasion and coercion, to move
him from his purpose. Yes, persuasion and coercion
of every possible kind and degree; for in this case
the end justifies the means.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, my dear brother, I agree with you perfectly;
it is just what I said.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, but at the same time,” said Billy Bothsides,
shaking his head, and glancing keenly at his sister,
with the astute air of one making a very fine distinction—“<em>at
the same time</em>, we are not to use any undue
or unfair influence over the young man.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, certainly not,” said Mrs. Sutherland.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, no, I never could consent to <em>that</em>, although I
would go to any justifiable or even unjustifiable
lengths, to cure the boy of his folly. You understand
me? You follow out my line of reasoning?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, no, brother William, I do not, clearly.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Women seldom do! women seldom do! But
never mind! Trust to me! <em>I’ll</em> bring him round
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span><em>I</em>—though I confess I do not believe it will be in the
power of mortal man to do it,” said Mr. Bolling,
rising from the table, and sauntering into the front
parlour.</p>

<p class='c005'>He found Mrs. Vivian monopolising the attention
of Mr. Sutherland, by making him translate for her a
sonnet of Petrarch. As soon as Uncle Billy appeared,
to relieve guard, Mrs. Vivian suddenly lost all interest
in Italian, dropped her book, and left the room, passing
Mrs. Sutherland on her way, to whom she said,
laughingly—</p>

<p class='c005'>“A pretty commencement I have made of it! First,
heard myself anathematised for a ‘pestilent widow’—next
made myself and three other people wretched
for an hour—those were, Sutherland, who was dying
to speak to India—Lauderdale, who was longing to
talk to me—India, who wishes to listen to Sutherland—and
last, not least, myself, who was quite willing to
hear what Lauderdale had to say.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mr. Lauderdale seemed quite—<em>pleased</em> with you
last night.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Pleased? Well, I should not be surprised. Perhaps
he means to make love to me this morning. If
he does not, perhaps—he’s only a college boy—I mean
to make love to him, <i><span lang="fr">pour se disennuyée</span></i>;” and waving
her fan playfully, and half curtseying, the trifler
glided off.</p>

<p class='c005'>And soon after she was seen promenading on the
piazza with young Lauderdale.</p>

<p class='c005'><i><span lang="fr">Ennuyée</span></i> with the <i><span lang="it">dolce far niente</span></i> of the morning,
Miss Sutherland ordered her carriage to return home.
Uncle Billy begged a seat inside, and Mr. Sutherland
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>and (at the invitation of the latter) Mr. Lauderdale
mounted horses to attend the party.</p>

<p class='c005'>Their way lay through a beautiful piece of woods,
that covered the hill, just rising, and then gradually
declining to the river. They crossed by a ferry.</p>

<p class='c005'>This part of the river, being the head of the bend,
resembled a beautiful woodland lake, lying embosomed
among its green hills and groves, which were all distinctly
reflected in the water, that was flushed with a
pale purple light, changing ever into azure or crimson,
or fading off into faint beautiful hues of pink or
saffron.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh! it is well named the Pearl—this lovely river—though
it might as well be called the Opal,” said
Billy Bolling, who had a taste for natural beauty.</p>

<p class='c005'>They were but few minutes in reaching the other
bank of the river, and landing at Cashmere.</p>

<p class='c005'>Arrived at Cashmere, the party passed up the winding
road leading through the groves and shrubberies
of the lawn, to the foot of the marble steps leading to
the rose terrace, and there alighting, passed through
the verandah into the house.</p>

<p class='c005'>Laughingly Mrs. Vivian took immediate possession
of Miss Sutherland, and carried her off to seek
Rosalie.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Sutherland, senior, happened to be in the house,
and Mark immediately introduced his friend Lauderdale.
The old gentleman welcomed the stranger with
the stately suavity habitual to men of his day and
station; but he received his nephew with an earnestness
of affection scarcely restrained by the presence
of a third party—pressing his hand with much warmth,
and detaining it lingeringly in his clasp.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>Mark Sutherland could hardly repress a groan, to
think how soon all this must be changed. Nay, more:
he even felt a species of compunction for receiving
his uncle’s kindness under what he felt to be false
colours; and he determined, if possible, not to let an
hour pass before having a full explanation with him.
And so, after the first compliments were over, and
when the planter arose and politely excused himself,
saying that important business called him over to his
new plantation, and expressing a hope that Mr.
Lauderdale would consider his house, servants, and
stables, entirely at his commands, Mark Sutherland
laid his hand solemnly upon his arm, and said—</p>

<p class='c005'>“My dear uncle, I must have a conversation with
you this morning.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My dear Mark,” said the old man, smiling—if it
could be called a smile—“I know what you are about
to ask, and I answer beforehand, <em>just as soon as India
pleases</em>. The sooner the better. I speak freely before
your friend”—bowing to the latter—“whom, I presume,
you have persuaded to do you the honour of
attending you upon the occasion. Consult my daughter!
You know her will is law in this affair.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My dear sir, it is upon another subject that I
really <em>must</em> consult you, at your very earliest convenience,”
said Mr. Sutherland, with such earnestness
of manner as to enforce serious attention.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, sir,” said the planter, “to-day you must
really excuse me. I have to go over to the new plantation.
Stoke, my manager there, thinks that the cotton
crop is not in a vigorous state; he fears that it is
taking the rot. But, excuse me—young men know
little and care less for the anxieties that make their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>elders slaves.” And, smiling and bowing, the old
gentleman withdrew.</p>

<p class='c005'>And Mark Sutherland, seeing no opportunity of
breaking his mind to either father or daughter for
the present, invited Lauderdale for a ride over the
plantation.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Sutherland rang, and ordered horses, which
were at the door in fifteen minutes, and he and his
friend mounted and commenced their ride.</p>

<p class='c005'>First winding round the shaded path at the foot of
the rose terrace, they turned to the left, and entered
the grove which surrounded three sides of the back
of the house. Half a mile’s ride through a narrow,
tangled pathway, up which they were obliged to proceed
in Indian file, led them to an elevated clearing
of about a hundred acres, on which was situated the
negro village, called, in plantation parlance, “The
Quarters.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“There! what do you think of that?” asked Mark
Sutherland, with a slight dash of triumph in his tone,
as they drew rein and paused under the shade of the
trees at the edge of the grove.</p>

<p class='c005'>Lauderdale’s eyes were roving leisurely and attentively
over the woodland village. It was certainly a
most lovely scene. The sky above was of the brilliant,
intense blue of southern climes; the foliage of the
woods around was of the vivid green of early summer.
A few large trees were left standing at intervals in the
clearing; and under these, and scattered at irregular
distances through the area, were the neat white cottages
with their red-painted doors. Each cottage had its
small vegetable garden, and some few of the better-kept
houses had their fruit trees, and even flower
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>yards. The village was deserted now, except by the
children playing at the doors, and the old people left
to take care of them. Of these latter, some were seated
upon the door-steps, and some were standing leaning
over the fence-rails; some were occupied with knitting
coarse stockings; and some, mostly men, were smoking
their pipes. All the able-bodied men and women
were out in the fields.</p>

<p class='c005'>Lauderdale looked on, first with an expression of
surprise and pleasure, but afterwards with a countenance
full of thought.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, my friend, how do you like that?” repeated
Mr. Sutherland.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I will give you my opinion more at large, later in
the day, my dear Mark,” replied Lauderdale; and
then he added, “I have been told that you have the
best stud and best stables in Mississippi; will you
favour me with the sight of those also?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Sutherland immediately assented. They turned
their horses’ heads, and taking another path, rode in
a circuit around to the site of the stables, which lay
at some distance to the right of the mansion house,
and were concealed from the latter by an intervening
arm of the grove. The stables were built in the most
approved modern style, with much architectural
beauty, and possessed every requisite for the health
and comfort of the noble animals for whose accommodation
they were designed. Here again Lauderdale
expressed no opinion, but asked to see—don’t start,
super-refined reader—the pig pens. Mark, with a queer
smile, conducted his guest to the desired premises;
and also, without waiting to be solicited, introduced
him to the cow pens, the hen house, etc. All these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>buildings had been constructed under the direction
of a celebrated English rural architect, and of course
were fitted with every modern improvement for the
well-being of the stock. Still Lauderdale as yet reserved
his judgment, while he expressed his thanks to
his host for the privilege he had enjoyed. Sutherland
mischievously asked him whether he would not also
like to see the pigeon boxes before dinner. Lauderdale
smilingly declined, and they returned to the
house. They alighted from their saddles and threw
the reins to the groom, entered the hall, and separated
to dress for dinner.</p>

<p class='c005'>Half an hour after, when they met in the drawing-room,
Lauderdale advanced to his host, and said,—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Sutherland, I must thank you again for the sight
of your plantation arrangements! and I must say that
<em>all</em> your stock—horses, cows, and pigs, and slaves—are
probably the best accommodated of any in the
state!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mark Sutherland, with a flushed brow, turned away.
But in an instant, Lauderdale laid his hand upon his
arm, and said, with a voice and manner full of affectionate
earnestness—</p>

<p class='c005'>“I mean to say just <em>this</em>, dear Mark—that your
negro village is comfortable, and even exceedingly
beautiful, but that no amount of physical comfort can
or <em>ought</em> to compensate an immortal being for the loss
of liberty!”</p>

<p class='c005'>The entrance of other members of the family and
the speedy announcement of dinner ended this conversation
for the present.</p>

<p class='c005'>Haggard, careworn, anxious, as he was, the deep,
ever-springing fountain of gladness in Mark Sutherland’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>heart dispersed all his gloom; and, during
dinner, when the jest and laugh went round, <em>he</em> was
as usual the spring of wit and humour to the party.</p>

<p class='c005'>After dinner, when he was about to seek an interview
with his betrothed, Mrs. Vivian forestalled him,
by carrying off Miss Sutherland to examine a box of
goods, lately arrived from New Orleans for the bride
elect. And Mr. Bolling, leaving Sutherland, senior,
to entertain the guest, ran his arm through that of
Mark, and marched him off in triumph.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, Mark,” he said, as soon as he had got him
on to the lawn, “I cannot understand it! how a young
man of your strength of character, of your firmness—nay,
obstinacy; stubbornness—should permit yourself
to fall a prey to these adventurers.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I really do not see how I am their prey, Uncle
Billy, or why they should be adventurers.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, Mark, you are—I mean, dear Mark, you want
experience of the world; and no amount of moral or
intellectual excellence will stand you in stead for
that. Nay, indeed, goodness will only make you the
easier victim, and talent the more useful tool to these
speculators.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Uncle, you wrong them! By the honour of my
soul, you do! You have never seen or heard but one
side of the question, and therefore you are bitterly
prejudiced.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Prejudiced! <em>Me</em> prejudiced! when everybody
knows that I am the most impartial person in the
world! But ‘moderation has its martyrs also.’”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You certainly are prejudiced in this matter; yet
how shall I set you right? And why should I be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>surprised? Once, there was never such a scoffer as I
was.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, and <em>that’s</em> just what raises the hair of my
head with wonder! Your good-humoured satire and
gay indulgence used to please me so much more than
your uncle’s haughty, scornful, persecuting resentment
of these people’s affronts. You used to laugh, and say
to your uncles, ‘Your anger is inadequate to the
offence; it is ungenerous. These objects of your displeasure
are very harmless enthusiasts.’ <em>And now!</em>
Ah, Mark, I call to mind the poet’s line—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘First endure, then pity, then embrace.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>You began by enduring, and you end by embracing
their doctrines. Ah, Mark! Mark! Mark! how came
it so?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Uncle, did you never hear of a gay man or woman
of the world—well enough in their way—not sinners
above all sinners, but with a certain light, satirical
way of treating serious subjects, and a certain good-humoured
contempt for those that entertained them—did
you never hear an instance of such a man or
woman going into a religious meeting to scoff, <em>but
returning home to pray</em>? Well, very much akin to
that was my experience. I went to the convention in
New York, just to fulfil a promise made to my friend
Lauderdale, and next to have a laugh at them! At
the first meeting—well; I am not going to give you
a report of it—sufficient is it to tell you that the subject
was presented to my mind in a new and startling
aspect. I laughed, or rather <em>tried</em> to laugh, it off.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I wish to goodness you had taken it more earnestly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>than to begin with laughing, to end with
imitating.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“At the second meeting, there were some still
higher, purer souls, and more eloquent and commanding
tongues; lips touched with fire, whose
words were flame consuming the wrong principle,
that shrivelled up before it. But I do not mean to
become eloquent myself. This is not the time or
place, nor are you the audience. It is enough to say
that the speakers in that meeting gave me the heartache
and the headache, and I wished in my soul I had
never entered their hall. Yet nevertheless a fascination
drew me there the third evening. And then,
whether ‘the master minds’ of the cause had said all
they had to say for the time, or whether they had not
yet arrived upon the scene of action, I really cannot
say—(for the room was crowded, and not by friends
of the cause, as you will hear, but by conspirators,
who had come there to break the meeting up)—but
certainly, after one short address of thrilling eloquence
and power—during the progress of which I felt myself
to be a participant in an injustice, and at the close
of which I was ready to make an irrevocable oath to
clear my life from the sin—up jumps a fellow, with
more zeal than knowledge, and more deviltry, I perfectly
believe, than either, and so defames me and my
fellow-citizens of the South, and so caricatures us as
monsters of atrocity, and so whirrs and rattles whips
and chains and gyves about my ears and eyes, that it
was the cast of a die whether I should laugh or swear.
But before it was decided, a resolution was put and
an amendment offered, and two or three people rose,
and half a dozen began to speak, and everybody
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>wanted to talk, and nobody—but me—wanted to hear,
and there was a confusion inside and a gathering mob
outside, and in an incredibly short time there was a
hailstorm of stones, and battered walls, and smashed
windows, and the meeting was broken up in a row;
and my Celtic blood boiled up and boiled over; and
while laying about me valiantly in defence of freedom
of speech, <em>I lost myself</em>. And when I found myself, I
was lying with a broken arm and broken head in the
watchhouse!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Good gracious, Mark! what a dishonour! What
would my sister, what would my niece, say to that?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“They do not know it, and they need not.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, really, one would have thought that would
have cured you!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My good uncle, it did—of <em>indecision</em>. One is very
apt to be confirmed to a cause in which they have
suffered somewhat. I lay very ill for two weeks.
During that time I was ministered to by some excellent
men, and <em>women</em> also—persons whose disinterestedness,
benevolence, gentleness, and perfect sincerity,
gave me such a deep and beautiful impression
of the Christian character as I had never received from
book or pulpit—persons who had sacrificed fortune,
position, friendships—<em>all</em>, to a pure but despised
cause. It was the silent influence, even more than the
spoken words of these, which fixed me forever in my
good purpose.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It may be true, Mark, that there are such, or it
may only have seemed so to you. What I know is,
that if there are such disinterested souls in the cause,
they are, at best, only the instruments with which the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>party leaders work for their own individual ends and
selfish purposes.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, it is not so, nor could it be so; wisdom and
goodness could not become the tools of selfishness and
worldliness.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now, Mark, don’t stand there and try to dazzle
your old uncle’s intellect, by a fine-sounding Joseph
Surface sentiment! You must either be a blockhead,
or take me for one, when you pretend to tell me that
the teachers of that party are not a set of self-seeking
agitators, whose motives range from the mere getting
of daily bread, up to the getting of political power;
and who, if it fell easily in their way, would as willingly
reach their ends by entering into the slave
trade, as by agitating the question of emancipation.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The hot blood crimsoned Mark Sutherland’s brow,
and he answered indignantly—</p>

<p class='c005'>“You speak of that of which you know nothing.
You speak of those whose”——</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ah! <em>don’t</em> I know nothing?” interrupted Mr.
Bolling. “Where is that Mr. Grab, who came down
here as a travelling preacher, and took that opportunity
(or perhaps he was sent on purpose, and paid to
do it) to preach abolition to the poor whites and the
blacks, and to do Satan knows what other mischief;
and the Lord knows what judgment would have fallen
on him from our incensed planters, if he had not been
offered an asylum in the house of your cousin, Mrs.
Tilden, who, being a sentimental, compassionate young
woman, and finding herself the protectress of a pale,
persecuted young preacher, began to court him, as
widows <em>will</em> court; and so, when all her brothers and
brothers-in-law came in force to turn him out and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>lynch him, they met the pair coming home from the
minister’s—<em>married</em>! The pretty widow, the plantation,
and the negroes, had proved most convincing
arguments, and had converted him. And now, when
he feels it necessary to defend himself from the charge
of treachery to his party, he says, ‘Oh, the erroneous
sentiments of his youth were the effects of ignorance
and enthusiasm!’ Umph, humph! we all understand
that—in his case second thoughts <em>paid better</em>.”</p>

<p class='c005'>During this speech, Mark had put down his anger,
and now replied, gravely and earnestly—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Uncle, it is a point that I must meet—this of
yours. It has given <em>me</em> much, deep pain. But why
should it make you scornful and incredulous of the
disinterestedness of these reformers, or why should it
give me sorrow? We must separate a high and pure
cause, and its devoted self-sacrificing supporters, from
its few unworthy advocates. Why, uncle, do we
reject Christianity because among the Saviour’s chosen
twelve there was one Judas, who was covetous, and
whose covetousness made him sell his master? Or
because among His many disciples there were some
who followed Him, hoping for high places in the
kingdom they supposed Him about to establish on
earth? Or, even now, do we all refuse to hear the
Gospel preached, because there have been some
Averys and Onderdonks in the pulpits? And shall
we stop our ears, and close our eyes, and fold our
hands before the cause of reform, for the reason
that there are some Grabs in the party? Nay, God
forbid!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mark Sutherland paused as in painful thought some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>time, and then, with more than usual emotion, he exclaimed—</p>

<p class='c005'>“I would to God there were <em>no</em> Achans in the
camp! For this work, that at the best is apt to arouse
so much evil passion—for this work, requiring so
much wisdom and goodness to carry it on aright—for
this work, more than for all others, should the
labourers have clear heads, and clean hands, and pure
motives.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then, after a short pause, addressing his uncle again,
and taking his hand, he said—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Uncle, <em>I</em> am about to sacrifice all I have in the
world, to principles I have but so lately embraced.
Well, sir, believe me, for it is God’s holy truth—notwithstanding
these Grabs who bring dishonour on their
cause, there are hundreds of philanthropists who have
sacrificed as much as <em>I</em>.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Indeed, <em>indeed</em>, Mark, you are very wrong and
foolish to do this thing! Very, <em>very</em> foolish and
wrong, indeed. <em>Nevertheless</em>, I am constrained to say
that you are perfectly wise and right in persevering
in your duty! <em>Yes, sir!</em>” said Mr. Bothsides, wiping
his face furiously, and stuffing his white handkerchief
back in his pocket. “And now, what do you mean
to do further?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I shall go to the West.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes—yes—yes—yes,” said Uncle Billy, meditatively;
“do so. Go to the West—go to some new
place, and grow up with it. It will be the easiest
thing on earth for you to rise in the world there, and
success in the end is almost certain—<em>though</em>—confound
it! you will find you’ll have to struggle very
hard, and be very apt to be disappointed at last. You
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>have no reason in the world to be the least bit discouraged—<em>but</em>—you
must not be sanguine—that I can
tell you! I make it a rule, without an exception
never to give advice, Mark—<em>notwithstanding</em>—if you
are ever at a loss how to act in an emergency, consult
me, Mark—my best counsel is at your service. And
I really think that with it you could not possibly go
wrong,” said Mr. Bolling, drawing his handkerchief
from his pocket and wiping his forehead, and replacing
it with a look of great self-complacency.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My dear Uncle Billy,” said Mark, with a quiet
smile, “believe me, I know how to appreciate your
fine, impartial judgment, and feel convinced that I
never should come to harm in following your advice.”</p>

<p class='c005'>With this proof of his high-minded nephew’s affection
and confidence, Mr. Bolling’s blue eyes filled
with tears, and he seized Mark’s hand, and squeezed
it, and shook it, crying—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Deuce fly away with you, Mark! I feel a perfect
contempt for your folly and wrong-headedness in this
matter—<em>nevertheless</em>—I am compelled to admit that I
am filled with unmingled admiration for the wisdom
and rectitude of your character and conduct! <em>Yes,
sir!</em>”</p>

<p class='c005'>This was said with great emphasis, and once more
the cambric handkerchief was brought into violent
requisition.</p>

<p class='c005'>An hour after the end of this conversation, Mark
Sutherland was seated in the library, impatiently
waiting the entrance of his uncle, with whom he had
at last succeeded in appointing an interview. He was
anxious, restless, and unable to occupy himself with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>anything, during the few moments which seemed ages
before the planter should enter. He tumbled over
the books, rumpled the papers, shifted his position
many times, started up and paced the floor, looked
out of all the windows in turn, and finally went to
the door to listen, and reached it just as it was swung
open in his face, and old Clement Sutherland entered.
The planter walked to the centre of the room, and
threw himself into his leather-covered chair at his
writing-table, saying, in a curt voice—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, sir, what is your business with me?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Startled by the unusual sternness of his manner,
Mark Sutherland turned and looked at him inquiringly.
The planter’s countenance wore an aspect of
severity that at once told his nephew that from some
cause or by some means he had been led to suspect
the nature of the communication the latter was about
to make him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Will you oblige me, sir, by opening your business
at once, as my time is somewhat valuable?” said
Clement Sutherland, looking at his watch.</p>

<p class='c005'>The young man bowed, drew a chair to the opposite
side of the table, took a seat, excused himself, and
deprecated his uncle’s displeasure for the painful subject
he was about to introduce.</p>

<p class='c005'>Here Clement Sutherland waved his hand impatiently,
begging that he would cut his introduction
as short as possible.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then the young man commenced to relate the
history of his life and experiences for the last preceding
three months; he told how he had been induced
to attend the colonization meetings, first merely
in the spirit of bravado; how, in hearing the subject
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>freely and ably discussed, the conviction had forced
an entrance into his soul.</p>

<p class='c005'>Here Clement Sutherland wheeled his chair around,
so that his back was presented to the light, and his
face cast into deep shadow, and from this instant to
the end of the conversation, Mark Sutherland could
not watch the expression of his countenance to judge
his mental comments.</p>

<p class='c005'>But he went on to relate how long and stoutly he
had struggled against this conviction; how at last it
had overcome him; how his pride, his selfishness, his
interests, his passions, and affections—all had yielded,
or must yield in any conflict between them and his
sense of duty.</p>

<p class='c005'>“<em>Facts, sir! facts!</em> Let us have no sentiments, no
moral or metaphysical disquisitions, but actual facts!
What do you intend to do?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mark Sutherland answered, calmly—</p>

<p class='c005'>“To free every negro on my plantation, and at my
own expense to send every one, who is willing to go,
to Liberia.”</p>

<p class='c005'>A scornful, most insulting laugh, was the only
comment of the planter.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And after freeing them, I must do all in my power
to place them in a situation of happier circumstances
for their present, and more hopeful probabilities for
their future, lives.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The young man here paused, and as the planter did
not answer, silence ensued between them for several
minutes, during which the latter passed his hand
slowly back and forth over his bearded chin. At
length Mark Sutherland said, in a troubled voice—</p>

<p class='c005'>“I do not wish to conceal from you, sir, the fact
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>that my greatest trial in this affair has been connected
with the thought of India.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Again he paused for a reply or comment. But the
planter only caressed his bristling chin, while his
countenance was inscrutable in the deep shadow.</p>

<p class='c005'>The youth spoke again:</p>

<p class='c005'>“It has been a subject of deep regret and anxiety
to me, to feel that I can no longer hope to offer India
a fortune or a position equal to her just expectations.
For myself, I have no doubts or fears for the future.
I feel within me a power to struggle and to conquer.
I feel assured that within a very few years my position
will be a higher one than it is now, or than it would
be were I to retain my present wealth. I believe that
my India will have no cause to blush for her husband,
or you for your son-in-law.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Still the old man did not make a single remark,
and so deep remained his face in the shadow, that the
youth could not read his thoughts. It was rather trying
to continue speaking under these circumstances;
but there was no alternative. He concluded by saying—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Although I have long enjoyed the pleasure of
your approbation in my addresses to your daughter,
I thought it proper to take the very earliest opportunity
of informing you of my purposes, and the consequent
change they must make in my fortune and
circumstances. And now, sir, I have told you all,
and I wait in much anxiety to hear what you have to
say.”—</p>

<p class='c005'>“What do you <em>wish</em> me to say?” dryly inquired the
planter.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Just what is on your mind, my uncle.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>“Humph! this is rather sudden, sir. It is true
that a few words dropped by Mr. Bolling, and unexpectedly
overheard by myself, in some degree prepared
me for the strange communication you have just
made. Still, it is sudden, sir! It is sudden! What,
may I inquire, did you <em>expect</em> me to say? How did
you anticipate that I should meet this?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mark Sutherland hesitated to reply, but got up and
walked the floor in an exceedingly troubled manner.</p>

<p class='c005'>A strange smile sat upon the face of the planter.
At last he said—</p>

<p class='c005'>“You doubtless, and with much justice, expected
me to withdraw my consent to the marriage of yourself
and my daughter. Did you not? Reply, if you
please.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Sir—my dear uncle!” said Mark, coming forward
again, “I had my doubts and misgivings about that.
It would have been unjust to you to have seriously
<em>entertained</em> them; and it would be unjust to myself to
say that I did so.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You were right, sir!” said the planter, with the
same inscrutable smile; “you were right—I shall not
interfere. Having once sanctioned your addresses to
my daughter, I shall not now oppose them. Miss
Sutherland is of age. I refer you solely to her.
If, under the new aspect of affairs, she is willing that
this engagement between you and herself shall stand,
and that the preparations for marriage proceed, I shall
throw no obstacles in your way. Nay, further, sir,
that in that case, the marriage shall be conducted
precisely as, under other circumstances, it was planned—that
is, in all things befitting the social position of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>myself and my sole daughter. Our interview is at an
end, I believe?”</p>

<p class='c005'>The <em>words</em> of Clement Sutherland would have called
forth from his nephew the warmest emotions and expressions
of gratitude, but that the tone and the smile
that accompanied them, more than neutralised their
good effect, and sent a pang of terrible foreboding
through the heart of the young man.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Pardon me, sir,” he said, laying his hand gently
and respectfully upon the arm of his uncle, as the
latter was rising to leave the library. “Do I understand
you to say that you approve”——</p>

<p class='c005'>“You will please to understand me to say, sir, that
I refer you to my daughter, Miss Sutherland, and that
I shall endorse her decision, whatever that may be.
Excuse me, sir—good afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And Clement Sutherland, coldly bowing, left the
library.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mark Sutherland walked up and down the floor in
great disturbance of mind, and then at last he seized
his hat and hurried from the room, to seek the presence
of India.</p>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“’Tis a proud chamber and a rich,</div>
      <div class='line'>Filled with the world’s most costly things,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Of precious stones and gold;</div>
      <div class='line'>Of laces, silks, and jewelry,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And all that’s bought and sold.”—<em>Howitt.</em></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>“Rosalie! what is it you are poring over, now?
Good heaven! Moore’s Sacred Melodies! Now, my
love, that is not the food for you to be feeding your
sick fancies upon! Plague take the books! I could
find it in my heart to throw every one I find into the
fire! Come, throw aside that <i><span lang="fr">blazée</span></i> sentimentalist,
and come with me into Miss Sutherland’s room, and
try to interest yourself a little in healthful external
life. Miss Sutherland’s boxes have just arrived from
Paris, <em>viâ</em> New Orleans; they have been carried up
into her dressing-room; and by this time, I suppose,
the men have opened them, and carried off all the
rubbish of nails, and bands, and outside boxes, and
we have only to go and help to set the beautiful things
at full liberty.”</p>

<p class='c005'>This was addressed by Mrs. Vivian to her step-daughter,
when, on entering the chamber of the latter,
she found the young invalid reclining upon a couch,
and reading, as usual.</p>

<p class='c005'>The fair girl closed her book, and smiling gently,
arose, and passed her arm through that of her step-mother.
And they left the chamber, crossed the hall,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>opened an opposite door, and entered the dressing-room
of Miss Sutherland.</p>

<p class='c005'>A scene of splendid chaos met their view. Most of
the boxes had been unpacked and taken away, and
their brilliant contents littered chairs, couches, ottomans,
psyches, and even the carpet. And the favoured
mistress of all this wealth sat in the midst of the resplendent
confusion, with an air of extreme languor
and indifference. At her feet sat her beautiful hand-maiden,
Oriole, with a box of white satin slippers by
her side, and her mistress’s small foot in her lap,
fitting the fairy shoes. By her side stood her woman,
Meda, holding a box of white kid gloves, from which
she continued to hand out pair after pair to the young
lady, who would draw one half upon her fingers, and
then draw it off and let it fall, and drop her hand upon
her lap with a look of extreme fatigue, as if the exertion
had really been too much for her, and say, languidly—</p>

<p class='c005'>“There, take them away; they are all too large, or
too small, or something”——</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dear India, how can you say that?” said Mrs.
Vivian, approaching, and taking up a pair of gloves;
“they are all exactly of a size, and all number sixes—your
number—and are really beautiful gloves.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But I’m so tired—it is such a bore. Oriole, cease
tormenting my feet, and take away those odious slippers.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“How can you call them odious—the beauties?”
said Mrs. Vivian, stooping down, and taking up a
pair.</p>

<p class='c005'>And Oriole herself echoed the question with her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>eyes, as she fondled her mistress’s beautiful foot, in
its case of white satin, soft and light as a snow-flake.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oriole, did I not tell you to let my foot alone?
Meda, clear away all this chaos from around me.
Rosalie, my love, reach me the vinaigrette”——</p>

<p class='c005'>“Can <em>I</em> also do anything to serve you?” asked Mrs.
Vivian, mischievously.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, dear Valeria; just see that they hang the
dresses up, and put away the cases and things, while
I close my eyes upon this glare, and rest.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mrs. Vivian arched her eyebrows, and did as she
was bid, examining at her leisure the magnificent
trousseau, as it was detailed off under her eye into
various wardrobes and bureaus. Only once she interrupted
the repose of Miss Sutherland, to ask her if
the wedding-dress had come.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Meda, tell Mrs. Vivian about it,” said the languid
beauty, scarcely lifting her long lashes.</p>

<p class='c005'>And the waiting-woman respectfully telegraphed
the lady, and preceded her into the adjoining chamber,
where upon the bed was laid the magnificent bridal
costume of white brocaded satin, the superb veil of
Honiton lace, and the beautiful chaplet of orange
flowers.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mrs. Vivian beckoned Rosalie, and when the child
stood by her side, they examined it together, and the
mother tried to make the daughter understand how
elegant, how costly, how <i><span lang="fr">recherché</span></i> was this costume.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And to think,” she said, “that India is so indifferent
about a trousseau that would have turned my
head when I was a girl. I don’t believe it <em>is</em> indifference
either; I believe it is affectation.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, it is not, mamma. She is really indifferent to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>all this. There is something troubles her. She was
not resting when she sat so still. I saw her lips
tremble and her eyelids quiver.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mrs. Vivian cast a scrutinizing glance at the girl,
thinking, “How is it that in some things she is observant?”
But Rosalie, almost unconsciously, was
repeating to herself the refrain of the song she had
been reading:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“All that’s bright must fade.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“Rosalie, have done with that sentimental melancholy;
it disturbs me; and it is untrue, besides. The
best things are most enduring. And it is all nonsense,
besides, to suppose that anything more serious than
indolence troubles India. And now, my dear, do you
know the programme of these bridal festivities and
tour, as we arranged it yesterday?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No,” said the young girl, trying to be interested.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mrs. Vivian dropped herself into an easy chair at
the side of the bed, and Rose sank upon the cushion
at her feet, and laid her head in the lady’s lap;
and while Valeria ran her fingers caressingly through
the soft ringlets of the child, she said—</p>

<p class='c005'>“The marriage was long ago fixed to come off on
Miss Sutherland’s birthday, and she and her friends
see no reason to change it now. That, you know, my
dear, is on the 15th of this month—a week from to-day.
The ceremony is to take place in the morning,
my love, and you are to be one of the bridesmaids.
Immediately after the benediction, the bridal pair are
to set out upon a tour of the springs and other places
of fashionable summer resort, of six weeks. You and
I, Rose, are going up into the pine woods, to a quiet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>farm-house, to spend the hot months; for indeed, dear
child, I do not think you strong enough to bear the
fatigue of a northern journey, or the crowd and bustle
of a watering-place.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dear mamma, how much you give up for me!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My child, I would do anything in the world to
see you restored to health and cheerfulness like other
young girls.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But this, sweet mamma, is too much to sacrifice.
It is too much for you to give up Saratoga and Nahant,
where you meet so many friends and admirers,
and where you enjoy and adorn society so much.
Mamma, do not think of giving this pleasure up, and
burying yourself for me in the pine woods. Let us
go to Saratoga.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My love! I tell you the long, fatiguing journey,
the crowded hotels, the execrable tables, the wretched
attendance, and the noise and confusion, would kill
you, Rosalie!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And then my sweet mamma would really be the
rich young southern widow she is generally supposed
to be,” said the girl, gazing on her young step-mother
with a fond, sorrowful smile.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, Rosalie! why did you say that to me, love?
Do you believe in the traditional selfishness of all
step-mothers, from the days of Cinderella’s step-dame
to yours? Or have you read such poetry as—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘There’s nothing true but heaven,’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>till you have lost faith in all things?—poetry that,
Heaven knows, gives anything but ‘Glory to God,
and peace and good will to man.’”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dear mamma, I am very sorry I said what I did.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>Oh, believe me, it was far from my heart to be so
cruelly unjust as I see you must think me! <em>You
selfish</em>—the most disinterested mother that ever cherished
a poor, sick, troublesome child! Oh, forgive
the light and thoughtless words that could be twisted
into such a hint.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Just tell me how you came to say what you did,
Rosalie, for the words trouble me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nay, never heed them, dear, kind mamma. Forget
them; they were wicked words, since they gave
you pain.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Rosalie, I insist upon knowing what put such a
thought into your head.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mother, sometimes I hear things not intended for
my ear, which, nevertheless, I cannot help hearing”—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Explain.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why, often when I have been reclining in a
shaded window-seat with a book, or lying on a distant
sofa with my eyes closed, and they think I am
asleep, or quite abstracted, I hear them say, ‘Poor
girl, she is a trouble to herself and all around her.’
‘She can never live to be a woman; so, if it were the
Lord’s will, it were better she should die now.’ ‘Her
death would be a great relief to the young widow;
and, by the way, Mrs. Vivian would come into the
whole property then, would she not?’ That is all,
dear mamma. Do not let it disturb you. It did not
disturb me the least.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mrs. Vivian placed her hand upon the bell. Miss
Vivian gently arrested her purpose, saying—</p>

<p class='c005'>“What are you about to do, mamma?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ring, and order our carriage. I will not stay in
this house, where you are so cruelly wounded, one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>minute longer than is required to put the horses to
the carriage.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dear mother, you cannot surely imagine that it is
in <em>this</em> house I have ever been injured, in word or
deed?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Where, then, Rose? Rose, you have distressed
me beyond all measure. Tell me where it is that such
wanton words meet your ear?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dear mother, almost everywhere where you and I
sojourn for any length of time. On our own plantation;
in our own house at New Orleans; at our
place in the pine woods; and while we are travelling,
in steamboats, in hotels—in short, wherever the great
world that knows us has entered.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The lady looked so deeply distressed, and the
maiden felt so grieved to see her troubled, that she
hastened to turn the conversation, by saying, gaily—</p>

<p class='c005'>“But, mamma, you did not finish telling me about
our summer arrangements. You said that immediately
after the marriage ceremony, the bridal pair would set
out on a tour of the northern watering-places, and
that you and I should go into the pine woods. And
what next?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“We shall spend two months in the pine woods,
where the terebinthine air is so strongly recommended
as the great specific for weak or diseased lungs; and
where the quiet and regular hours, plain, simple food,
and gentle exercise, will bring back the colour to my
child’s cheeks. And, after two months, when my
drooping rose will be fresh and blooming again, I will
take her to Charleston, South Carolina, there to meet
the married pair by appointment, and who, it is to
be hoped, will then be sufficiently satisfied with each
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>other’s exclusive society, to be able to tolerate <em>ours</em>
for a little while. When we join them, we embark
across the ocean, and make the tour of Europe together—winter
in Sicily, and return home next spring.
And by that time, I hope, the sea voyage, the change
of scene and of climate, will have completely restored
my darling to health!”</p>

</div>

<p class='c004'>While Mrs. Vivian sat talking with her daughter
in the bed-chamber of Miss Sutherland, the latter remained
in the adjoining dressing-room, where we left
her seated in the easy chair, with her hands folded
upon her lap, and her eyes closed as in gentle repose,
only sometimes a half-smothered, shuddering sigh disturbed
the statue-like stillness of her form. It was no
deep sorrow, no great anxiety, that troubled this
favourite of fortune—only, being quite unused to
pain of any sort, physical or mental, she was impatient
of its lightest touch. But she had that day been summoned
to the presence of her father, and by him had
been informed of Mr. Mark Sutherland’s whole plan,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>as he had just learned it from the latter. The planter
had told his daughter, with distinct and dreadful detail,
of all the numerous privations, toils, hardships,
and humiliations, and vaguely hinted at a countless
variety of suffering she must endure, if she should
become a party to her lover’s purpose. He had further
assured her, that if she should remain firm in
opposing the plan of her lover, his resolution must
finally yield to his affection for herself. And at last
he had wrung from his daughter a promise, that she
would make the total resignation of Mr. Mark Sutherland’s
plans the only condition upon which their
marriage should proceed. And so the interview between
father and daughter had closed; and Miss
Sutherland had returned to her room with little disposition
to be amused by the variety and splendour
of her newly-arrived trousseau. And, by seeming
lassitude and nonchalance, she had drawn upon herself
the unjust censure of Mrs. Vivian, and the wondering
compassion of the more sympathetic Rosalie.</p>

<p class='c005'>India never for an instant doubted her power over
Mark Sutherland; nay, she never mentally even
limited the <em>extent</em> of that power. The worst she anticipated
was a controversy with her betrothed. That
this controversy could end in any other manner than
in her own favour, she never once inquired. That his
fanaticism must yield to her influence, she felt certain.
But she did not like to have to exert this influence.
She admired and honoured Mark Sutherland above
all men—nay, there were times when she feared him
above all things. And she loved him as those of her
clime only love. And with all her faults, this spoiled
child of fortune was too true a woman to wish to take
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>the position and tone of a dictator to the man she so
loved. Nay, she felt indignant with all concerned in
thrusting upon her such inevitable, yet such repulsive,
“greatness.” And now she sat trying to compose
her nerves and collect her thoughts for the
unavoidable interview to which she momentarily expected
to be summoned.</p>

<p class='c005'>She had not much longer to wait. A servant soon
entered, and, bowing, informed her that Mr. Sutherland
requested the favour of an interview at her
earliest convenience, and desired to know when and
where she would receive him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Where is Mr. Sutherland?” inquired the young
lady.</p>

<p class='c005'>“In the library, Miss.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Proceed thither and announce me, then.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Arrived at the library, the man opened the door,
and merely saying, “Miss Sutherland, sir,” held it
open until she had passed in, and then closing it,
retired.</p>

<p class='c005'>And India found herself alone with Mark. He was
sitting at a central library-table, leaning with his
head resting upon his hand; his face was very pale,
his countenance haggard, his dark hair slightly
dishevelled, his manner disturbed and anxious, yet
withal controlled. He arose and advanced to meet
her, led her to a sofa, and placed himself beside her.
Taking her hand in his own, and pressing it gently,
he looked down into her face, regarding her with a
grave, sweet, sad, almost solemn expression of countenance;
and, after a brief pause, he said, “My dearest
India, you cannot be at a loss to understand my motive
for requesting this interview?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>He paused, as expecting her assent, but she did not
reply in any way. She did not even lift her glance
from the carpet. He pressed her hand fondly, and
resumed: “My love, the time has come, the opportunity
is presented for us—even for <em>us</em>, my India—to
put in practice some of those high examples of heroism,
which in others have so often won our fervent
admiration. Even <em>we</em>, my India, may”—</p>

<p class='c005'>She arrested his serious words by suddenly drawing
her hand away, and hurriedly exclaiming, “I have
heard something of your purpose of manumitting the
people on your various plantations. But I would
prefer to hear your plan of benevolence, or philanthropy,
whichever it may be, from your own lips, unwarped
by prejudice, and uncoloured by passion, and
<em>with as little preface as possible</em>!”</p>

<p class='c005'>The coldness and reserve of her words and tones
smote him to the heart. Nevertheless, he replied,
“My purpose is no plan of benevolence or philanthropy,
my dear India, but a simple act of justice,
originating in a simple impulse of conscientiousness.”
Then gently repossessing himself of her hand, he held
it tenderly in his own, while he began, and, for the
fourth time since his return home, related all the
mental and moral experiences that had led him to
determine upon the contemplated act of emancipation.
She heard him out without again interrupting him.
She sat very still, with her face pale and impassable,
and her eyes cast down. She was no match for him
in argument, yet, nevertheless, seeing that he silently
awaited her answer, and preferring to convert rather
than to cast him off, she recalled and repeated all the
arguments she had ever heard in defence of slavery;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>she began by saying that she thought the existence
of the system of slavery to be the manifest will and
ordination of Divine Providence; and she wondered
how any rational being could doubt it. Was not
their present subordinate position here infinitely
preferable to their former savage and cannibal condition
on the coast of Congo? Here at least they were
Christianized.</p>

<p class='c005'>A smile dawned upon the young man’s countenance.
She saw and felt it. Her cheek flushed, and she
hastened to say—</p>

<p class='c005'>“They must be blind indeed, Mr. Sutherland, who
cannot see in the enslavement of the African race by
the Anglo-Saxons the purpose of Divine Providence
to civilize Africa.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mark Sutherland took her hand, and replied
gently—</p>

<p class='c005'>“My dear India, we do not deny that God continually
brings good out of evil; but is <em>that</em> a justification
of the evil? And even admitting, for argument’s sake,
that the reduction of a portion of the Ethiopian race
to slavery by the Anglo-Americans is to be the means
of Christianizing them, is it not full time, after two
hundred years of bondage, that some of this harvest
sowed with tears and blood should be reaped?—that
some of these good fruits should begin to be enjoyed?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Besides,” said Miss Sutherland, eluding his question
and evading his eye, “there is a fitness in these
relations between the European and the African races—Europeans
could not engage in agricultural labour
under the burning heat of our Southern sun”——</p>

<p class='c005'>“But why <em>enslave</em> the negroes—why not emancipate
and hire them?” interrupted Mark.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>“O! you know,” she replied, hastily, “that the
negroes will not work effectually, unless driven to it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Plantation slaves will not, I grant you; but what
has reduced them to this hopeless and inert condition?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I do not know why you should call their condition
hopeless—I think, upon the whole, they are at least
as hopeful and as happy as poor white people, or free
blacks. And I never heard of a bad master, who was
not also a bad son, brother, husband, father, neighbour—in
short, who was not a bad Christian. And if you
feel a call to reform the world, Mark Sutherland, why
not begin at the right end, and Christianize it—and
all other reform will follow early, and as a matter of
course. Why not do that?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Because, my dear India, unluckily the world thinks
itself already Christian. ‘And if the light that is in
it be darkness, how great is that darkness?’ Neither,
my dear girl, am I the missionary to dispel it. I am
quite unworthy of, and unpretending to, the name of
Christian, and have no presumption to begin reforming
the world, either at the right end or the wrong
end. I only wish to do what I consider a simple act
of justice, in a matter between me and my own conscience.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I do not understand why your ‘conscience’ should
meddle in the matter. The system appears to me to
be perfectly right—every thing that we can wish.
There is a beautiful adaptation in the mutual relations
existing between the Anglo-Saxon master and the
Ethiopian slave; for, observe, the Anglo-Saxon is
highly intellectual, strong, proud, firm, self-willed, impelled
to govern, gifted with great mental independence;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>the Ethiopian, on the contrary, is very <em>un</em>intellectual,
weak, lowly in mind, imitative, affectionate,
docile, easily controlled—and these traits of character
so harmonize in this connection, that it seems to need
only the spirit of Christianity to make it a beautiful
and happy correspondence.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I think, my dearest girl, that even in that case the
‘beautiful and happy correspondence’ would be like
Irish reciprocity—<em>all on one side</em>. Selfishness so blinds
us, India”——</p>

<p class='c005'>I have no space to dilate on what was said on either
side. Both grew very serious, earnest, and emphatic.
India became heated, fevered; she brought forward
every plea she had ever heard pressed in favour of her
own side of the controversy; but she was not his
equal in logic. Baffled and disappointed in her failure,
and unnerved by the strangeness of anxiety and contention,
she suddenly burst into tears, and passionately
exclaimed—</p>

<p class='c005'>“You do not love me! You never loved me! You
prefer the fancied welfare of these miserable negroes
to my comfort and happiness!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mark Sutherland saw and felt only her tears and
sorrow, and addressed himself to soothe her with all
a lover’s solicitude. She took advantage of his tenderness—perhaps
she even misunderstood it. She had
failed to convince his judgment by her arguments,
failed to change his purpose by opposition and reproaches,
and now she resolved to try the power of
love—of persuasion. She let him draw her to his
bosom; she dropped her head upon his shoulder, with
her blushing, tearful face and soft hair against his
cheek, her arm upon his neck, and half-caressing, suffered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>herself to be caressed, and let him feel how
sweet her love was, by the unutterable sweetness of
her shy caress; and when his heart was weak unto
death, she pleaded with him, yieldingly, submissively,
tearfully, as with one who had the right and the power
of ordering her destiny—that he would not doom her
to a lot so cruel, so terrible; that she was so unprepared
for it; that he must know she was; that it
would kill her in a year.</p>

<p class='c005'>All this was pleaded with her head upon his
shoulder, with her face against his cheek, with her
hand pressed around his neck. This seductive gentleness
was very hard to resist, indeed. He answered—</p>

<p class='c005'>“My dearest India, you are sole mistress of your
own destiny, and, to a great extent, of mine. I did
hope that you would have borne me company in my
pilgrimage, and, even from the first, have shared my
lot, hard as it is sure to be. We have both read and
heard how women, even the most tenderly reared and
delicate, have, for affection, for constancy, for truth,
and the great idea of duty, borne poverty, toil, hardships
and privations, even with a better grace and
with more fortitude and patience than the strongest
men. But I begin to think that history and tradition
must exaggerate. How, indeed, could my own fragile
lady-love endure what <em>my</em> strong frame must encounter
and overcome? No, dear India, ardently as I once
desired that you should be, from this time forward,
the partner of my lot, I see and feel that the wish
was thoughtless, unreasonable, selfish. It was exacting
far too much. No, dearest, painful as it must be
to tear myself from you, I must go forth alone to do
battle with an adverse fate. Yet why should I call
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>it adverse? I go forth with youth, and health, and
strength; with a liberal education, and some talent;
and when I have attained fame and fortune, then, like
a true knight, I will come and lay them at my lady’s
feet, and claim—no, not claim—but <em>sue for</em> my blessed
reward.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She said that she could not let him go; it would
break her heart to part with him. Could he leave
her to break her heart? Would he not give up his
purpose for her sake, and stay with her? Her head
was still upon his shoulder, and her face against his
cheek. With a slight movement, at once shy and
fond, she pressed her lips to his neck, and repeated
her question: Would he not give up his purpose for
her sake, and stay with her?</p>

<p class='c005'>He felt his fortitude and strength fast leaving him.
Amidst the fondest caresses, he said—</p>

<p class='c005'>“My own dear India! how have I merited such
love? My India, I will not stay so long as I said. I
will not stay till I have won fame or fortune. I cannot
remain away so long. But as soon as I have won
a modest competence—in a year or two—I will be
back to claim my blessing.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Her tears fell like rain. Still she clasped, and
pressed, and kissed his neck, and said that would not
do at all; he must not leave her—no, not for a week;
she could not, would not, bear it; she should die.</p>

<p class='c005'>He kissed away her tears, fast as they fell, and then
proposed again that she should go with him, promising
to do more than man ever did, or even could do, to
shield her from hardship till all hardship should be
over, as it surely would be in time.</p>

<p class='c005'>With a few deep-drawn sighs, she lifted up her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>head, and answered, No, she could not go; she was
far too delicate to bear such a change; he ought to
know it, and ought not to ask it. <em>No, if he loved her</em>,
he must give up his project, and stay with her; <em>and
if he did love her</em>, he surely would do it. Any man
that really loved would do that much for his lady.</p>

<p class='c005'>She was evidently merging from her tender, alluring
mood, into an irritable and capricious one.</p>

<p class='c005'>Full of doubt and trouble at her words, he answered—</p>

<p class='c005'>“My dearest India, I told you that this purposed
action of mine is a measure of conscience. You
know it involves an immense sacrifice. Do you suppose
that I would make that sacrifice, except from the
most righteous principles, and do you suppose I can
possibly abandon such principles? My India, if from
my great love for you I could now sacrifice my conscience
to your convenience, you would soon lose all
esteem for me, and, in losing all esteem, lose all comfort
in loving me. My India, no honourable woman
can continue to love a man who has forfeited his own
and her respect. Do you not know that?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Coldly she put away his encircling arms—coldly
she withdrew herself from him, saying—</p>

<p class='c005'>“I see how it is, sir! You do not love me; you
are faithless; you seek an excuse to break with me,
by putting our union upon conditions impossible for
me to comply with. You need not have taken such
a crooked path to a plain end, sir; you needed only
to have frankly named your wish, to have had your
plighted troth restored. You are free, sir——to unite
yourself with one of the favoured race, the objects of
your manifest preference, if you please”——</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>This last, most insulting clause was cast at him
with a glance of insufferable scorn, as she turned to
leave the room.</p>

<p class='c005'>His brow crimsoned with the sudden smite of shame,
and—</p>

<p class='c005'>“<em>This from you, India!</em>” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c005'>She was looking at him still; but the scorn and
anger slowly passed from her face, as he rose and advanced
towards her, saying—</p>

<p class='c005'>“But you are excited; I will not lay your bitter
words to heart, nor suffer you to leave me in anger.
Dearest India!”</p>

<p class='c005'>She had already regretted her sharp words; love
and anger were balanced in her bosom so evenly, that
it took but a trifle to disturb the equilibrium; and
now his forbearance and his kind words completely
upset the scale, and love ascended. Turning to him
once more, and throwing herself in his open arms, she
burst into tears, and said—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dearest Mark, only give up this mad, mad project,
and I am all yours. Oh, you know I am, any way;
for even now the separation that would pain you,
would kill or madden me! But, oh! you know I
cannot endure the hardships you would prepare for
me; they would be equally fatal. Give it up, Mark!
Dear Mark, give it up, for my sake, for your dear
mother’s sake, for all our sakes! Stay with us! do
not divide us, and break our hearts, by leaving us!
We all love you so! you know we do! We would
do anything in the world for you, if you would stay
with us! And I only grow angry and lose my senses,
and utter mad words, when you talk of leaving us!
Don’t go, Mark! Dearest Mark, don’t leave us.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>And so she pleaded, hiding her tears and blushes
on his shoulder, and clasping, and pressing, and kissing
his neck and cheek. The pleadings of young
beauty to young love, most powerful, most painful to
resist, yet they were resisted, mournfully, but calmly
and firmly, resisted.</p>

<p class='c005'>She raised her head from his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And you persist in your purpose?” she said.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My India, I cannot do otherwise.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Notwithstanding all the suffering you may cause
your mother, your relatives, and me?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My own India, I would I could bear all your
grief in my own person.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But you adhere to your resolution?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have no alternative.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And this is your final decision?”</p>

<p class='c005'>He bowed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Even if you should lose me for ever?”</p>

<p class='c005'>He started, as if suddenly struck by a bullet. He
changed colour, but did not speak. She regarded
him fixedly. At last she said, slowly and calmly—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Will you please to answer my question?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“India,” he said, “I will not for a moment, admit
such a possibility. God will never repay fidelity to
conscience with calamity.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Perhaps it might not <em>be</em> a calamity. I think it
were well we should understand each other. The
question is now before you—do not evade it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My India, it is not <em>practically</em> before me. No,
thank Heaven, the intolerable alternative of resigning
you or my principles is <em>not</em> yet before me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“By all our past dreams, and present hopes, of happiness,
I assure you that the alternative is now submitted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>to you, sir. And I adjure you, by your conscience,
and by the strength of your vaunted principles,
to decide the question, which I now repeat to
you—if the adherence of your present purpose involve
the final loss of my hand and heart, do you still
persist in that purpose?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Something in her tone caught up his glance, to rivet
it upon her. Never in all their lives had she seemed
to him so beautiful, so regnant, so irresistibly attractive.
He gazed upon, he studied her face; nor did
she turn it from him, nor avert her glance. She met
his searching gaze proudly, fearlessly, imperially; she
seemed to wish that he should read her soul, and
know its immutable determination. There was no
pique, no anger, no weakness, or wavering, on that
high, haughty brow now; there was nothing but
calm, indomitable resolution. He gazed upon her in
wonder, and in sorrow, some time fascinated by the
imperious beauty of her young brow, and marvelling
that this could be the tender, seductive woman that
lay cooing on his bosom scarce an hour ago. It
would not do to waver now. He took her hand again.
He answered, solemnly—</p>

<p class='c005'>“India, you have adjured me, by my conscience,
by the sacredness of my honour, to answer your question,
and say whether, were the alternative finally
before me, I should resign my resolution, or be resigned
by you. India, I may not, must not, evade
this. And I answer now, by my sacred honour and
my hopes of heaven, come what may, of trial, of suffering,
or of agony, I will never forego this purpose,
to which reason and conscience alike urge me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And that is your final determination?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>He bowed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now, then, hear mine; but first I give you back
your plighted troth and its less perishable symbol”—here
she drew a diamond ring from her finger, and
handed it to him—“and I remove your image from
my heart with less difficulty than I disentangle this
miniature one from my chain”—here she took a locket,
set with diamonds, from her chatelaine, and handed
him. He received both pledges back, and stood with
a certain mournful dignity, awaiting her further words
and actions. “And now,” she said, “let me make
you thoroughly acquainted with my thought upon
this subject which so interests you, so that you may
see how far, as the East is from the West, is my
thought from yours. Know, that I like the position
that I occupy, the power that I wield; our plantation
is as large as a German or Italian principality; our
people are better governed, more prosperous, and more
profitable, than the subjects of such a principality.
We have more power than its prince. And I was
born to this power; I am accustomed to it; I like it.
Heaven crowned me with it; and do you think that I
will discrown my brow to become—what? A drudging
peasant? <span class='sc'>Never!</span> And now, hear my oath. As
you are the ‘dupe’ of a party, we separate, never to
meet again until you have recovered manhood and
independence enough to abjure this pernicious influence,
and abandon the mad project to which it has
forced you—so help me God!”</p>

<p class='c005'>And, turning haughtily away, she left the room.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>It was over. Until this, he had not realized his
true position. Nay, he did not fully realize it now.
He sat, as one stunned, in the seat into which he had
dropped when the door closed behind her. Until now,
he had been elevated by a high enthusiasm in his
purpose, and supported by a firm faith in her sympathy
and co-operation—a faith, the strength of which
he had not known until it was stricken from him, and
he was left weaker than a child.</p>

<p class='c005'>Why! it really had not seemed so great a sacrifice
to resign wealth and position with <em>her</em> by his side—with
<em>her</em> approving looks, and smiles, and words—with
<em>her</em> cordial, affectionate concurrence. And how often
the picture had glowed before his imagination, as he
recalled her kindling cheek, and kindling eye, and
fervent imagination, while reading with him of some
heroic deed of self-devotion in <em>another</em>! And when he
thought of all that earnest enthusiasm with himself
for its object——forgive him, it was no better than a
lover’s aspiration, perhaps; but all his soul took fire
at her image, and all things seemed easy to do, to be,
or to suffer, for such an unspeakable joy. That <em>he</em>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>should be her Curtius, her Bayard, her Hampden,
Sydney, her <em>hero</em>. And until now, he had believed
this, and had lived and acted under a strange illusion.
And if for an instant his faith in her sympathy had
ever been shaken, it was merely as the Christian believer’s
trust is shaken, only to strike its roots the
deeper after the jar.</p>

<p class='c005'>But now—oh! this was indeed the bitterness of
death! In the first stunned moment after his fall from
such a height of confidence and joy, into such a depth
of desolation and wretchedness, he could scarcely believe
in his misery, far less analyze it, and detect its
hidden and bitterest element. And <em>this</em> was its bitterest
element—the ascertained antagonism of his
India—her <em>utter</em> antagonism! This was the weapon
that had felled him to the earth. This was the fang
of the adder, struck deep in his heart, and poisoning
all his soul!—with what? With distrust!—distrust
of her, of himself, of all men and women! As yet, all
this he felt, without acknowledging, nay, without perceiving
it. He sat there as one in a trance. And the
hours that passed over him were as a blank.</p>

<p class='c005'>He was aroused by psychological disturbance.
Why should he immolate himself upon the altar of
a principle that one half of the Christian world would
consider a mere madness? And how if, after all, it
<em>was</em> madness? How if he was self-deceived?—actuated
by fanaticism, and not by legitimate heroism? <em>She</em>
whose whole soul had glowed at the mere mention of
<em>true</em> magnanimity—<em>she</em> whose approbation had been
the ardently desired reward of his sacrifice—the object
of his young heart’s passionate aspiration—how had
<em>she</em> regarded him? As a hero or a fanatic! How had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>she received him in his new aspect? Not as he had
often fondly prevised—not with a faithful, loving clasp,
strengthening his hands—not with a fervent, inspiring
gaze, imparting courage and energy to his soul—not
with approval and sympathy, and faithful cordial concurrence,
confirming his faith—arming him for any
conflict—strengthening him for any sacrifice. Oh! no,
no; far otherwise. She had heard him with repelling
hand and averted eye, and scorn, and loathing, and
repulsion, that had left him bitterly disappointed,
humbled, weakened, prostrated, <em>paralyzed</em> by self-doubt!</p>

<p class='c005'>Was she right? Was he a madman?</p>

<p class='c005'>Oh! there had been an element of worship and of
aspiration in his love for India. And was this idol a
mere stone, upon which he had broken himself in
vain? He could not bear to think so. He was
willing to believe himself a fool or a madman, so that
her image remained undimmed, unspotted, unchanged
in its shrine—so that she was still a perfect woman,
angel, goddess!</p>

<p class='c005'>And was this not truly so? Was her decision not
really just, and was he not indeed a fanatic?</p>

<p class='c005'>To <em>believe</em> this, would end the struggle and the
agony at once. To <em>confess</em> this, would restore harmony
and happiness to the grievously-disturbed family
circle, and peace and joy to himself and his India!
How easy to step down from his pedestal of principle,
frankly confess it to have been a false position, taken
in a fit of generous, youthful enthusiasm; to jest over
it with his friends—<em>friends recovered by that step</em>; to call
himself Don Quixote the younger, laugh at the matter,
and dismiss it to oblivion. And then India! This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>beautiful, bewildering girl would be his own in five
days. That vision whelmed him in vague, intense
delirium.</p>

<p class='c005'><em>Would</em> it be so easy to step from his post, to abjure
his principles, to silence his conscience?</p>

<p class='c005'>No! Even amid the intoxicating dream of his
beautiful India’s love, his stern soul answered, No!</p>

<p class='c005'>He knew that he had <em>not</em> taken a false position—the
Tempter could not persuade him that he had done
so. He knew himself to be right; he knew that he
was not self-deceived. Not even now, in this hour of
bitter trial, would his moral sense be so confused. In
his conscience, the dividing line between right and
wrong was too clearly, distinctly, sharply defined, and
there was no possibility of confusing or mistaking the
boundary.</p>

<p class='c005'>And so the mental sophistry of the temptation
ended.</p>

<p class='c005'>And now for the moral conflict. Admitted that his
convictions were those of pure rational duty, why
should he sacrifice so much to them? Did <em>others</em>
around him do so? Did <em>any one</em> live up to his or her
high idea of right? On the contrary, <em>who</em> did not
silence the voice of conscience every day of their
lives? <em>Who</em> in this world was not, in their turn, and
in their way, more or less unjust, selfish? And did
they not, the best of them, compound for all this by
going to church, and confessing themselves “lost and
ruined sinners,” and returning with a clean conscience,
like a tablet newly sponged over, and prepared to be
inscribed all over again with the same sins, to be
effaced in the same manner? Now, why could not
he also do his pleasure, enjoy his wealth, hold to this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>world, and secure heaven—all on these easy terms?
It was only to make a profession.</p>

<p class='c005'>It would not do. His heart, it is true, had not been
touched by the spirit of Christianity, yet his mind
was too clear and right to deceive itself so delightfully
about this matter. That grace of God which hath
appeared unto <em>all</em> men, taught him that Christ was
not the minister of sin—not one who gave out patents
conferring impunity in sin, and signed with his
own life-blood—not one who wiped out the sins of
the soul, as men sponge out marks from a note-book,
to make room for more of the same sort of matter—not
one to make his own righteousness the shield for
our wilful unrighteousness. In a word, he felt and
knew that Christ was not the minister of sin.</p>

<p class='c005'>This sorely tried and tempted man had made no
professions, had used no cant, but he nevertheless possessed
a large portion of natural conscientiousness,
and he had a frank, light-hearted manner of doing
right, bordering on levity and nonchalance—a manner
tending to mislead superficial observers into
making too shallow an estimate of the depth and
earnestness of his convictions and principles.</p>

<p class='c005'>All his family, from the cold-hearted, clear-headed
Clement Sutherland, down to the ardent and impulsive
India, had miscalculated the strength of his character
and the firmness of his purpose. And hence
the <em>comparative indifference</em> with which they had
hitherto received the communication of his intentions.
I say comparative indifference; for though indeed the
family were much disturbed that he should for a moment
entertain such purposes as he had revealed, yet
none of them had doubted that the influences which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>should be brought to bear upon him would compel
him to abandon his project. And thus agitation at
this time was calmness, perfect halcyon peace, in comparison
with the confusion, the chaos, the tremendous
storm of indignation, opposition, and persecution, that
afterwards arose and hurtled around him. There are
no wars so bloody as civil wars; there are no feuds
so deadly as family feuds; there are no enemies so
bitter, so cruel, so unrelenting, as those of our own
blood, when they <em>are</em> enemies! Others may spare,
but they will <em>never</em> spare! Others may in time become
sated with vengeance, but <em>they</em> never! while
their victim has one faculty of mind left uncrazed, or
one heartstring unwrung. Others may in time be
touched by some sense of justice; <em>they</em> never! they
hold to and defend their cruelty. Others may repent;
<em>they</em> never. It would seem that a fatal blindness of
sight and hardness of heart fell upon them as a judgment
from Heaven for their unnatural sin.</p>

<p class='c005'>Perhaps <em>you</em> think that the days of martyrdom
have been passed ever since the stake and the faggot
went into disrepute; and that the spirit of persecution
went out with the fires of Smithfield. If you do,
may you never have more reason for thinking otherwise
than is contained in the simple narrative before
you. I am not going to enter minutely into the details
of all the scenes that followed that last interview
between Mark and India. I have all this time gone
around and about the subject, fearing or disliking to
approach it. In real life, evil, malignant passion is
not really the graceful and dignified and all but too
fascinating thing that we see it represented on the
stage—for instance, in the toga and buskins of Brutus,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>and Cassius, or the train and plumes of Lucretia
Borgia. Nor has it a stately, measured gait, a sonorous
utterance, or a grand gesture. It is a humiliating
fact, but it <em>is</em> a fact, that it looks and behaves very
much more like an excited Terry or Judy at a fair. It
shakes its fists, and strides, and vociferates, and chokes,
and stutters. Fierce anger, hatred, and vengeance
are of <em>no</em> rank. They show just as hideous, revolting,
and <em>vulgar</em>, in the prince or princess, as in the
meanest peasant. And all this has been suggested by
the recollection of the manner in which Mark Sutherland
was treated by his family.</p>

<p class='c005'>He had made one more attempt to obtain another
interview with India, by addressing to her a note.
This note was returned, with the seal undisturbed,
and with an insulting menace to the effect that any
communication addressed by Mr. Mark Sutherland to
Miss Sutherland must be preceded by a complete and
final renunciation of his present purposes, before it
could be received by her. Full of bitterness, he wrote
to her again, and concluded his note thus:—</p>

<p class='c005'>“I know you now, India; I know you perfectly. I
no longer worship you. Alas! there is nothing in
you to worship, or even to approve beyond your enchanting
beauty. And yet I love you still for that
bewildering beauty and for the dream that is passing
away. And you love me for something better than
that; you love me, now that for conscience I withstand
you, as you never loved me before. You wrong
me in taking yourself away. You take from me mine
own. There is a voice in your heart that assures you
of this. But you stifle that voice. You outrage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>Nature—but beware! Be sure that Nature is a dread
goddess, and Nemesis waits upon her bidding!”</p>

<p class='c005'>There is something awful in the just anger of a
noble-minded, pure-hearted, high-spirited man; and
thrice awful is it to the woman who loves him, when
that anger falls upon herself.</p>

<p class='c005'>India received <em>this</em> letter, and as she read it, bitter
and scalding tears fell upon it. He had surmised the
truth—she <em>did</em> love him now with ten-fold strength
and fervour, now that she had tried and proved his
strength. There was something in him to love, to lean
upon, to worship—something far more reliable, more
attractive, and more binding than mere masculine beauty—than
the stately form, the dark, spirited countenance,
and the fascinating gaiety, that had pleased her childish
fancy. There was firmness, courage, fortitude, <em>moral
strength</em>; something that a true woman loves to rest
upon, serve, adore. A wild and passionate longing
seized her heart—to go and stand by him in his
emergency—to help to sustain him, if it were ever so
slight a help, in this storm of opposition.</p>

<p class='c005'>While the soul of India was convulsed in the terrible
struggle between her strong and passionate affection,
and her invincible spirit of antagonism, Mark
Sutherland lingered at Cashmere. The habit of considering
himself a son of the house could not easily be
uprooted; and the absorption of all his thoughts and
feelings in the subject of his broken relations with
India, prevented him, for a time, from perceiving the
cold and scornful demeanour of the master of the
house. Had he not been totally abstracted in mind,
he would not for an hour have borne the arrogance,
which neither age nor relationship justified.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>Miss Sutherland had perseveringly absented herself
from the drawing-room, and from the table—confining
herself to her own room, and taking her meals
there.</p>

<p class='c005'>At length one day, the family, as usual, with the
exception of India, sat down to dinner. There were
present Clement and Paul Sutherland, Mrs. Vivian,
Miss Vivian, Mr. Bolling, Mark, and Lincoln—a party
of seven persons claiming to be refined women, or
honorable men; in a word, ladies and gentlemen—enough,
under any emergency, to preserve the decencies
of a family dinner-table. Clement Sutherland,
the host, sat with the usual cloud upon his brow.
When the waiter was about to lift the cover from the
dish before him, he arrested his act, by saying—“Stop,
sir! where is Miss Sutherland? Go, and let
her know that dinner waits.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The man bowed and left the room. An embarrassing
pause and silence ensued, during which Clement
Sutherland sat back in his chair, with a scowl
upon his yellow forehead, with an expression and an
attitude that he doubtless supposed to be awfully
tragic and imposing, and which, in truth, was inexpressibly
disagreeable, and even alarming; for all
present felt that under all that ridiculous dramatic
acting there was some real offence meant—some mean,
unmanly, inhospitable act to be perpetrated. In about
ten minutes, the servant returned. Entering, and
stepping lightly, he went up to his master’s side,
bowed, and in a low voice said—“Miss Sutherland,
sir, has ordered me to say that she desires to be excused.”
And, with another bow, the waiter retired,
and stood behind his master’s chair. Clement Sutherland
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>started up with an angry gesture, pushed his
chair violently behind him, to the risk of upsetting
my gentleman-waiter, and exclaimed—“Sirs, I have
to ask you if the laws of hospitality are to be so
abused as to exile my daughter from the head of the
table, and how long it is your pleasure that this state
of things shall continue?”</p>

<p class='c005'>This explosion was just as shocking as though something
like it had not been expected.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mark Sutherland, with a crimsoned brow, arose
from his chair.</p>

<p class='c005'>Lincoln, with perfect self-possession, deliberately
arose, walked into the hall, took down his hat, returned,
and, standing before Clement Sutherland, deliberately
said—“Mr. Sutherland, permit me to make
a due acknowledgment of the hospitality you have extended
me, and also to express my regret that it has
been so unpardonably trespassed against. I shall be
most happy if you will afford me the opportunity to
reciprocate the hospitality, and atone for the trespass.
Good day, sir.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh! young man, you have nothing to thank me
for.” Bowing to the ladies present, Lincoln withdrew.
Mark Sutherland snatched his hat, and, without
a word of leave-taking, left the room.</p>

<p class='c005'>All the other members of the family circle remained
seated at the table, with the exception of Miss Vivian,
who, rising, excused herself, and retired.</p>

<p class='c005'>When Mark Sutherland reached the rose terrace,
he called to Lincoln to stop, and wait until their
horses were saddled. And then he hastened off to the
stables to give his orders.</p>

<p class='c005'>In a very short time the horses were brought up,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>and the young men mounted, and gallopped away
from the house. They rode on in silence for some
time—Lincoln buried in calm thought, and Mark
enrapt in a sort of fierce reverie. At length he backed
his horse close up to Lincoln’s steed, seized his hand,
and exclaimed, “Lauderdale, how can I ever atone
for exposing you to such insult?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Insult? My dear fellow”—(he was just about to
say, “Mr. Clement Sutherland <em>cannot</em> insult me;” but,
delicate and generous in his consideration for the
feelings of Mark, he only said)—“look into my
face, and see if you think I am very much troubled.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And, indeed, the pleasant countenance of the youth
was well calculated to re-assure his friend.</p>

<p class='c005'>They relapsed into silence as they approached the
river. Sutherland was absorbed in mournful and
bitter reverie, which Lauderdale forbore to break.
They crossed the Pearl in perfect silence; Lincoln
glancing from the beautiful semi-transparent river,
with its surface softly flushed with rose and saffron
clouds, to the gorgeous fields of cotton, with its
myriads beyond myriads of golden white flowers.
When they left the ferry-boat, and cantered up the
gradual ascent of the road, and entered upon the
domain of Silentshade, once more Mark put out his
hand and seized that of his friend, saying, “Here at
last is <em>my</em> home, where I may welcome any friend of
mine for any length of time; and I do not so much
<em>invite</em> you, as I <em>entreat</em> you, to come and stay with me
as long as you can give me your company, if it be
only, dear Lincoln, to prove that you forgive me the
offence that has been offered to you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Pray say no more about it, dear Mark; how are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>you responsible for an affront offered <em>yourself</em> as well
as me? As for staying with you, I will do so with
the greatest pleasure as long as I may.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And once more Mark Sutherland fell into silence—into
bitter and sorrowful meditation—into deep despondency.
Since India’s haughty rejection of his
hand, his life had grown very real to him. Before
that, he had thought, spoken, and acted, as one under
the influence of some inspiring dream. His anticipation
and appreciation of the trials that awaited him,
differed as much from the real experience of them as
the imagining of some glorious martyrdom falls short
of the suffering it.</p>

<p class='c005'>Young enthusiast that he was, he had thought only
of the excitement and glory of the heroism, and not
of the fierce torture and maddening shame of the sacrifice.
But now he felt his position in all its dreadful
reality. And it was well that he should so feel it. It
would test his sincerity, try his strength, prove his
character. And now he rode on despairing, almost
heart-broken. Yet even in this dark and clouded
hour, one bright star of hope, and promise, and
strength, shone on him—a mother’s love—a mother’s
undying, unchanging love. It has been the theme
of poets, of philosophers, and of novelists, since hearts
first beat with affections, and tongues first gave them
utterance. It is the chosen Scripture illustration to
express even the divine love of God. The young
man rode along, deeply musing on that mother’s love—deeply
thirsting for it. He felt—man as he was—that
it would be a sweet and grateful relief to sit by
her side, to drop his proud, but weary head upon her
shoulder, and for a little while to give vent to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>flood of sorrow now stifled in his bosom—sure, that
if others thought even such a transient yielding to
grief unmanly, she, that tender and affectionate mother,
never would think so. And so he mused upon
that love—the only earthly love that never faileth—that
neither misfortune can abate, nor crime alienate.
And, unfortunate and suffering in the cause of conscience
as he was, how confidently he trusted in that
mother’s sympathy and support! Yea, though all
other affection might fail him—though friends should
forsake, and relatives abandon him, and even his
bride discard him—she, his mother, would be true!</p>

<p class='c005'>He would have staked his salvation upon this, as
they turned into the avenue of limes leading up to
the house, and saw Mrs. Sutherland standing, smiling,
upon the piazzi. But, on seeing the young men
approach, in one instant, the lady’s countenance
changed.</p>

<p class='c005'><em>She had had her lesson.</em></p>

<p class='c005'>Without advancing one step to meet and welcome
them, she allowed them, after dismounting from their
horses, to walk quite up the steps, and to the very
spot where she stood, and to bow and speak, before
she relaxed one muscle of her countenance.</p>

<p class='c005'>She replied to their greeting in the coldest tones,
inviting them to enter the house.</p>

<p class='c005'>For an instant, Mark and Lincoln raised their eyes
to each other’s face, and their glances met. A pang
of mortification and disappointment sped through
the heart of Sutherland; and Lauderdale, apparently
not the least surprised or disconcerted, took his resolution.</p>

<p class='c005'>Preceded by the lady, they entered the house, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>passed into a front parlour, and at her cold invitation,
which seemed more like a strained and reluctant permission
granted, they took seats. Nothing could be
more deeply disagreeable and embarrassing than the
next few minutes. Mrs. Sutherland took her sofa in
perfect silence, turned her face towards them with a
look of cold enquiry, and assumed the air of waiting
to hear what might be their business with her—what
they might have to communicate.</p>

<p class='c005'>This was very perplexing. They did not come on
business—indeed, they were made to feel that <em>they
had no business there</em>. They had come to be entertained,
and comforted, and compensated, after the Clement
Sutherland infliction. They had nothing particular
to answer to that cold, questioning look, except Lauderdale,
who, cool as his own clime, informed Mrs.
Sutherland that the day was “very fine.” The lady
bowed in silent assent.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The weather for many days past has been very
pleasant,” continued Lincoln, without the least embarrassment.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes—I think the present state of the atmosphere
highly favourable to <em>travelling</em>,” said the lady.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Your climate here, madam, is not near so sultry
as we of the North have supposed it to be,” persevered
Lincoln.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hem—yet at this season we think it too hot to be
wholesome to you of the North,” said the lady, with
a curling lip.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Humph,” thought Lauderdale, “your courtesy,
madam, is cold enough to cool the hottest hour of the
hottest day, in the hottest clime under the sun.” But,
turning to his friend Mark, said—</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>“Sutherland, if madame will excuse us, will you be
kind enough to let me have my room?”</p>

<p class='c005'>And Mark, released from the vice into which he
had felt himself compressed for the last ten minutes,
very gladly sprang up to accompany him. Lauderdale
bowed to Mrs. Sutherland, with some pardonable
formality of ceremony, perhaps, as they left the
parlour.</p>

<p class='c005'>When they had reached Lincoln’s chamber, in the
second story, Mark threw himself into a chair, and
covered his face with his hands. Lincoln went calmly
to work, packing up his wardrobe. After a while,
seeing that Sutherland kept his attitude of humiliation,
he went up to him, clapped him upon the shoulder
cheerfully, and said—</p>

<p class='c005'>“<em>Never</em> mind, my dear Mark! <em>never</em> mind! You
take this to heart far more than necessary. Now, I
dare say that one of your hot-blooded, fire-eating
Mississippians, treated as I have been, would call
somebody out, and do something desperate; but I
really do not feel obliged to do anything of the
sort.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“<em>I</em> am a Mississippian—do you consider <em>me</em> a very
hot-blooded person? Am I not rather a miserable
poltroon, to see my friend and guest outraged and insulted
as you have been?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, that is as fine a piece of self-accusation as I
have met with since reading the formula of confession
in a Roman Catholic missal. You could not help it,
Mark—you could not affront age or womanhood, in
my defence or your own,” said Lauderdale; and he
resumed his packing.</p>

<p class='c005'>In a very few minutes it was completed, and then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>he came to announce his departure to Mark, and to
take leave of him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have nothing to say to you, dear Lincoln—nothing
whatever, except once more to entreat your
pardon for what has passed, and to wish you well
with all my heart.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He could not seek to change his guest’s purpose—could
not ask him to remain; how could he do so,
indeed? He wished to order the carriage, but Lincoln
positively refused to avail himself of it, saying
that he would walk to the next village, and send for
his trunks. Mark impressed upon him the use of his
own riding-horse, and Lincoln, to avoid wounding
him, accepted it.</p>

<p class='c005'>The young men then went down stairs; Lincoln
entered the parlour, to bid adieu to his hostess, and
Mark left the house to order the horses, for he was
resolved to accompany his friend.</p>

<p class='c005'>In a few minutes they were in their saddles, and on
the road leading to C——, a muddy, miserable town,
about five miles down the river.</p>

<p class='c005'>Here the friends finally separated, but not until
Lincoln’s trunks had been sent for, and had arrived,
and Lincoln himself had entered the stage that passed
through the village that night, and was to convey him
to the steamboat landing on the Mississippi, by which
route he preferred to return north. They took leave
with mutual assurance of remembrances, and promises
of frequent correspondence.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was late at night when Mark Sutherland returned
to his home, and he immediately went to his
room.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>He arose the next morning, with the full determination
to set immediately to work.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I must plunge myself into action, lest I wither by
despair,” might have been his thought. His mother
received him at the breakfast table with coldness. He
told her respectfully what he intended to do during
the day. She curled her lip, and begged him to proceed,
without remorse or fear, to unroof the house
that sheltered her head—and she trusted Heaven
would give her strength to bear even that.</p>

<p class='c005'>After breakfast, he set out, and rode to Jackson, to
engage the services of a lawyer to assist him in
making out the deeds, and taking the legal measures
required in emancipating his people. As the distance
to the city was a full day’s journey, and he had business
enough to occupy the whole of the second day,
he did not reach home until the evening of the third
day.</p>

<p class='c005'>He came, accompanied by a lawyer. They were
both tired and hungry, but found no supper prepared,
and no one to make them welcome. Mr. Sutherland
went out, and enquired for his mother, and was told
that the lady desired to be excused from receiving an
official, that had come to make her homeless. Mark
stifled a sigh; he ordered refreshments for his guest,
and soon after showed him to his sleeping chamber.</p>

<p class='c005'>The next day was a very busy, yet a very trying
one. On coming down into the breakfast-room, Mark
Sutherland heard with poignant sorrow that his mother
had departed from the house, carrying with her
many of her personal effects, as if for a long or permanent
absence, and had gone to take up her abode
in Cashmere. In consternation at this act, Mark
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>Sutherland rushed out to institute further enquiries,
and found in front of the house a baggage-waggon,
with Billy Bolling standing up in the midst, receiving
and packing away trunks, boxes, and packages, that
were lifted to him by two negro men in attendance.</p>

<p class='c005'>“In the name of Heaven, what is the meaning of
all this, uncle?” asked Mark with trepidation.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Bolling stood up, took his handkerchief leisurely
from his pocket, wiped his flushed, perspiring face,
replaced it, and answered—</p>

<p class='c005'>“It means, sir, that you have turned my sister out
of doors; that is all it means.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But, uncle, my dear mother has perfect”——</p>

<p class='c005'>“D——n it, sir, don’t call my sister mother, or me
uncle! You are no son or nephew of ours; we wash
our hands of you! We cast you off! We’ll have
nothing to do with you!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why, Mr. Bolling, what is the”——</p>

<p class='c005'>“Confound it, sir, don’t talk to me; you are a villain,
sir! James, drive on!” And clapping his hat
upon his head, Mr. Bolling sat down and settled the
last box in its place, and the waggon was driven off.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is impossible to describe the state of mind in
which Mark Sutherland found himself. The distracting
thoughts and emotions that whirled through his
brain and heart, excited him almost to frenzy. He
immediately wrote an imploring, passionate note to
his mother, briefly alluding to the independence he
intended to secure to her, and supplicating her to return
to her own home. He sent it off; and, in a few
minutes, unsatisfied with that note, he wrote another,
more affectionate, more ardent, more supplicating,
and despatched that also.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>And then, half-maddened as he was, he turned and
set himself to his business. He caused all the servants
to be assembled on the lawn. He went out to
them, and announced his intention of setting free, and
sending all who were willing to go, to Liberia. He
explained to them the good that must accrue to the
younger, and more intelligent and industrious among
them, who might emigrate and settle in the last-named
place. This news did not take the negroes the least
by surprise. They had heard whisperings of the
cause that had broken off their master’s marriage, and
set all his family and friends at feud with him. After
closing his little speech to the assembled slaves, he
singled out some dozen among them—heads of cabin
families—old and steady men; and he took them with
him into his library, where he explained to them, at
greater length, the advantages of the plan of emigration
to Liberia. And then he dismissed them, to converse
with each other, to reflect, and decide what they
wished to do.</p>

<p class='c005'>Next, he left his study to go and enquire if the
messenger sent to his mother had returned. He found
the man watching for him in the hall. He held a letter
in his hand. Mr. Sutherland eagerly snatched it.
It contained a few lines, formally advising him that
no further communication would be received from
him, which was not preceded by a full and complete
renunciation of his obnoxious plans. While his gaze
was painfully riveted upon this note, the second messenger
arrived, bringing a letter in his hand. He
seized it. <em>It was his own, returned unopened.</em></p>

<p class='c005'>“Did you see Mrs. Sutherland, Flamingo?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>“What did she say?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I gave her the letter, sir; she took it, and read
the direction, and handed it back to me, and told me
to take it back to him who sent it, and not to bring
her another one.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That will do—you may go,” said Mark, and a
spasm of pain twitched his countenance, as he tore up
the letter, and threw the fragments away.</p>

<p class='c005'>“That is not all, sir—there is something else.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, what new stab?” he thought; but he <em>said</em>—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, what is it?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Flamingo took from under his arm a small packet,
wrapped in tissue paper, and handed it to him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What is this? Where did you get this?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Miss Rosalie gave it to me to bring to you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You may go now,” said Mr. Sutherland, as he
opened a door, and passed into the parlour, and sat
down to look at the packet. It was a little morocco
case, containing a lady’s small pocket Bible, bound in
white velvet and silver, with silver clasps. An elegant
little <i><span lang="fr">bijou</span></i> it was. Upon the fly-leaf was written,
“<em>Rosalie Vivian, from her affectionate and happy mother.</em>”
And this writing bore a date of several years before.</p>

<p class='c005'>On the opposite page was inscribed, “<em>Mark Sutherland,
with the deep respect of Rosalie Vivian.</em>” And this
inscription bore the date of to-day. A leaf was folded
down, and when he opened it at the 27th Psalm, he
saw marked this passage: “When my father and my
mother forsake me, then will the Lord take me up.”
There was still another page turned down, and another
pencil stroke, enclosing these words, (Mark x. 29,)
“And Jesus answered, and said, Verily, I say unto
you, there is no man hath left home, or brethren, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or
lands, for my sake and the gospel’s, but he shall receive
an hundred-fold now in this time, houses, and
brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and
lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come,
eternal life.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He turned over the little book with a fond look and
smile—partly given to the elegant little <i><span lang="fr">bijou</span></i> itself,
such an inappropriate sort of copy to be sent to a
man—and partly to the fair, gentle girl, its donor.
The little incident came to him like a soft, encouraging
pressure of the hand, or a kind word at his
greatest need—like a loving benediction. And for
those blessed words that were marked, they were
dropped into his broken and tearful heart, like good
seeds into the ploughed and watered earth, to bring
forth fruit in due season.</p>

<p class='c005'>He replaced the little book in its case, wrapped it
again in its tissue paper, and, for the present, lodged
it within the ample breast of his coat. He had never
in his life heard Rosalie give expression to one fine
heroic sentiment, such as fell plenteously from the
lips of India, as the pearls and diamonds from the
fairy favoured maiden of the child’s story. But now
he could not suppress the painful regret that the brilliant
and enthusiastic India had not possessed more
of the tenderness, sympathy, and real independence,
found in the fragile, retired Rosalie.</p>

<p class='c005'>It were tedious, as needless, to follow Mr. Sutherland
through all the multifarious and harassing details
of business that filled up the next few weeks.
His path was full of difficulties. Not only social and
domestic discouragements, and legal obstacles and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>delays, but difficulties that arose on the part of the
negroes themselves. A few of them did not want the
old state of things, with its familiar associations, and
close attachments, broken up. Some of them, who
were anxious to be free, had wives and children, or
husbands, upon some neighbouring plantation, and so
were held bound by their affections. Nay, indeed,
often a mere fraternal love was sufficient to produce
this effect. This class of negroes, proved to be a great
trial and vexation to Mark, not only by throwing
nearly insurmountable obstacles in the way of their
own emancipation, but also affording his opponents
much material for laughter. It was in vain their
benefactor told these men, that, after a few years of
labour and saving, they would be able to purchase
their wives or children. They shook their heads—they
feared—their spirits were too faint. As far as
his means would go, Mr. Sutherland purchased these
wives or children, and sent them off with their husbands
and fathers.</p>

<p class='c005'>At length, it was all over—the slaves were emancipated
and gone, each with a sum of money to pay
their transport, and provide their immediate necessities,
until they should find work. Many misgivings
troubled the head of Mr. Sutherland, as to whether
they would do well with the liberty, so unaccustomed,
and so newly given; but no doubts as to the righteousness
of his own act ever crossed his mind. And
so he committed the result to Providence.</p>

<p class='c005'>He had taken care to secure the homestead to his
mother. For her benefit, he had also placed at interest
thirty thousand dollars, which, at six per cent.,
would yield her an income of eighteen hundred.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>Having thus wound up his business, he went over
to Cashmere to seek an interview—a <em>farewell</em> interview—with
his mother and relatives. He learned that
they had, a few days before, left Cashmere for the
North.</p>

<p class='c005'>The next morning, Mark Sutherland, with only
ninety dollars in his pocket-book, with his wardrobe
and his law books, departed from his childhood’s
home.</p>

<p class='c005'>It may be as well to state here, that when the
Sutherlands returned, in the autumn, Mrs. Sutherland,
with some ten or twelve slaves, her own personal
property, took up her abode at Silentshades, availed
herself of the income her son had secured to her, and
made herself comfortable.</p>

<p class='c004'>The sun was rising in cloudless splendour, on the
morning on which Mark Sutherland paused upon an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>eminence, to throw a farewell glance over the beautiful
scenes of his childhood and youth—the fair valley
of the Pearl. East lay the dark boundary of the pine
forest, pierced by the golden, arrow-like rays of the
level sun, or casting long, spear-like shadows athwart
the green alluvion—south and west, belts of forest
alternated with gaudy cotton-fields, and rolling green
hills, interspersed with graceful groves, until in softly-blended
hues they met the distant horizon. From
this beautifully-variegated circumference, his eye returned
to gaze upon the centre of the scene—the
Pearl—the lovely river which took its name from the
semi-transparent hues of clouded saffron, rose, and
azure, that seemed not only caught from the glorious
sky above, and the gorgeous hills, and fields, and
grove, around, but flashed up from the deep channel
of the stream, as if its clear waters flowed through a
bed of opal.</p>

<p class='c005'>At some distance below him, encircled by a bend
of the river, lay—like some rich mosaic on the bosom
of the vale—“Cashmere,” the almost Oriental scene
of his youthful love-dream. There was the pebbly
beach, with its miniature piers and fairy boats—the
lawn, with its flowering and fragrant groves, its crystal
founts, its shaded walks and vine-clad arbours; and,
nearer the house, the rose terrace, with its millions of
odoriferous budding and blooming roses, surrounding
as within a crimson glow, that white villa and its
colonnade of light Ionic shafts. At this distance, he
could see distinctly the bay window, with its purple
curtains, of India’s boudoir; and, at its sight, the
image of the beautiful India arose before him. Again
he saw her in that poetic harmony of form and colouring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>that had so ravished his artist soul—the slender,
yet well-rounded figure—the warm, bright countenance,
with its amber-hued ringlets, and clear olive
complexion deepening into crimson upon cheeks and
lips—a beauty in which there was no strong contrast,
but all rich harmony—a form that he once had fondly
thought clothed a soul as harmonious as beautiful.
They were lost! all lost—home, and bride, and lovely
dreams of youth! Do not despise him, or blame him,
when I tell you, in the touching words of Scripture,
“that he lifted up his voice and wept.” He was but
twenty-one, and this was the first despairing passionate
sorrow of his youth.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is very easy to talk and write of the “rewards
of virtue,” the comfort of a good conscience, the delights
of duty. Alas! I am afraid the delights of duty
are seldom believed in, and seldomer experienced.
Be sure, when a great sacrifice of interest, of affection,
of hope, is made, and a great sorrow is felt—nothing—<em>nothing</em>
but a loving, Christian faith can console.</p>

<p class='c005'>And Mark Sutherland was not a Christian man.</p>

<p class='c005'>Here, then, even a philanthropist might reasonably
inquire <em>why</em> all this was done? <em>Why</em> a youth, born
and brought up a slaveholder, should, against preconceived
ideas, against prudence, against self-interest,
against hope, with doubtful good even to the beneficiaries
of his self-devotion, beggar himself for the
sake of their emancipation? Why he, being no
Christian, should make such an immense sacrifice of
wealth, position, affection, hope—in short, of all temporal
and earthly interests?</p>

<p class='c005'>We are all able to answer, that, had a scientific
phrenologist examined the moral organs of Mark
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>Sutherland’s head, he would have found his answer
in the predominant <span class='fss'>CONSCIENTIOUSNESS</span>. It was, therefore,
only a severe sense of justice that laid its iron
hand upon him, obliging him to do as he had done—a
single sense of justice, such as might have influenced
the actions of a Pagan or an Atheist—a hard, stern
sense of justice, without faith, hope, or love—an uncompromising
sense of justice, without self-flattery,
promise, or comfort.</p>

<p class='c005'>He is not as yet a Christian, but he may become
one, he must become one, for no great sacrifice was
ever made to duty, without Christ claiming that redeemed
soul as his own.</p>

<p class='c005'>After all, perhaps, there is but one sin and sorrow
in the world—<span class='sc'>Idolatry</span>—and all forms of evil are
compromised within it. It includes all shades of sin,
from the lightest error that clouds the conscience, to
the darkest crime that brings endless night upon the
soul; and all degrees of suffering, from the discontent
that disturbs the passing hour, to the anguish and
despair that overwhelms and swallows up all the
hopes of life. We are all idolaters. Some god-passion
of the heart is ever the deity we worship. Ambition,
avarice, love—“the world, the flesh, or the
devil,” in some form, is always the idol. Perhaps,
love; the first, the most disinterested, self-devoted,
of all the forms of idolatry, comes nearest to the true
worship. But it is not the true worship—by all the
anguish that it brings, it is not the true worship.</p>

<p class='c005'>Oh! if but for a moment we could raise our souls
to God, in the self-surrender wherewith, in passionate
devotion, we throw our hearts beneath the feet of
some weak and perishable form of clay—<em>that</em> were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>conversion—that were regeneration—that were a
great deliverance—that were eternal life, and full
of joy!</p>

<p class='c005'>And are there not moments when we catch a glimpse
of such a possibility? when brain and heart stand still,
thoughtless, breathless? when life itself pauses in the
transient revelation of such unsufferable light? And
we know that some have entered in and lived this
light all the days of their lives. To many of us,
alas! and in most of our moods, they seem to live
in an unknown world—to speak in an unknown
tongue.</p>

<p class='c005'>Who of us has not occasionally experienced these
thoughts and emotions, in reading and meditating on
the lives and characters of Christians of <em>any name</em>?—it
matters little what; for there is a unity of spirit in
all regenerated children of God, of every nation, rank,
or <em>sect</em>. Fenelon and George Whitefield—the Frenchman
and the Briton—the mitred archbishop and the
poor field preacher—the Roman Catholic and the
Methodist, dwelt in the same light, spoke the same
language, because both were one in spirit. What if
through the medium of each separate brain, the theology
look different? The heart is greater than the
brain; or, in other words, the affections are higher
than the intellect. “Out of the <em>heart</em> are the issues
of life;” and “<em>this</em> is life eternal, that we should know
the true God, and Jesus Christ whom he hath sent.”
With their hearts, their affections, they discerned
Him. And in love they were one with each other,
and one with Christ and God. And who, in communing
with their fervent souls—in meditating on
their perfect faith and love—perfect devotion to God,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>has not been startled by some such light as this let
in upon the mind?—“Why, if this unfailing love—this
unwavering faith—this unreserved devotion—this total
self-surrender—be the worship we owe to our Creator,
then have we been idolaters; for all this instinct and
power, and <em>necessity</em> of loving, sacrificing, and worshipping
has been ours, and has been lavished, wasted,
only on the creature.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Akin to this was the feeling that impelled the dying
Wolsey to exclaim, “Had I but served God as diligently
as I have served the king, He would not have
given me over in my grey hairs.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And as Mark Sutherland stood gazing in bitterness
of spirit upon the beautiful scene of his love
and joy, the maddening scene of his trial and suffering,
these words escaped from his bursting heart:
“Oh, God! if I had worshipped thee as I worshipped
<em>her</em>, Thy beautiful work, I had not been now alone—alone
in my sorrow.”</p>

<p class='c005'>It was the sincere, earnest cry of a stricken, penitent,
suffering heart.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was answered then and there. Around him fell
an influence sober and more genial than sunshine—more
refreshing than dew—a spiritual influence, warming,
renewing, supporting—a Divine influence, kindling
and strengthening the soul within him.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Comforter had come, and was acknowledged.
With uncovered head, and uplifted heart, then and
there Mark Sutherland consecrated his life to the service
of God, and His work on earth.</p>

<p class='c005'>From the beautiful vale he turned, and, inspired
by new strength and courage, put spurs to his horse,
and galloped rapidly on towards the road leading to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>the town of C——, where, six weeks since, he had
parted with Lauderdale. He reached C—— in time
for an early breakfast. Here—not wishing to leave
his family in ignorance of his fate, and by his departure
thus to cut down the bridge of communication
between them and himself—he addressed a letter to
his bachelor uncle, Paul Sutherland, informing him
that his destination was some north-western town,
whence, as soon as he should become settled, he should
write. He gave this letter in charge of the landlord,
to be forwarded as soon as his uncle should return
from the North. He then mounted his horse, and
took the road to Natchez, whence he intended to embark
in a steamboat up the Mississippi. He reached
the city by nightfall, and found his baggage, sent by
the stage-coach, had arrived in safety. He took the
boat that passed that night; and the next morning
he found himself many miles on his way up the river.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The world was all before him, where to choose</div>
      <div class='line'>His place of rest, and Providence his guide.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>And to a young, adventurous, hopeful spirit, this
uncertainty, joined to liberty, was not without its peculiar
charm. During the greater part of the day he
remained on deck, with a spy-glass in his hand, examining
the face of the country on either side of the
river. The lawns and villages on the Lower Mississippi
did not attract him in the least degree. Their
situations were low—their beach sluggishly washed
by the thick and murky water—their thoroughfare
wet and muddy—their general aspect unwholesome
to the last degree.</p>

<p class='c005'>But, farther up the river, and above the mouth of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>Ohio, the country and the colour of the water began
to change. High bluffs, gray old rocks, and gigantic
woods, diversified the shores—crystal creeks and verdant
islets varied the river. He approached the fine
“Rock River country.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Beautiful as a poetic vision of Elysium, had seemed
the luxurious valley of the Pearl.</p>

<p class='c005'>But this gigantic scene—Rock River, Rock Island,
with the opposite shores of the Mississippi, widening
here into a lake-like expanse—had a breadth of grandeur,
a Titanic vigour and vitality of beauty, the
most consonant, the most imposing and encouraging,
to his own young energetic spirit.</p>

<p class='c005'>The boat stopped opposite the village of S——, just
as the morning mist was rolling away before the sun,
and revealing the scene in all its picturesque beauty,
and fresh life. The young city was but two years old—yet,
infant of the Titaness West, it was growing
and thriving most vigorously. Here, then, Mark
Sutherland determined to take up his abode—here to
live and labour. He ordered his baggage into the
boat, and stepped in after it, and was swiftly rowed to
the shore. Here, too, in order to begin aright and
betimes, he shouldered his own trunk, while a porter
followed with his box of books, and wended his way
to the hotel on the hill.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Eighteen months have passed since Mark Sutherland
left his home. Eighteen months of persevering
study, of unsuccessful effort, and of varied wanderings,
find him, at the close, in Cincinnati, quite penniless,
and nearly hopeless. His efforts to find employment
here are unavailing. He has not even the means to
pay his board—a situation in which many a worthy
and promising young man has found himself, who has
afterwards nevertheless risen to fame or fortune.
Embarrassing and discouraging enough is the position
while occupied, however piquant to look back upon.</p>

<p class='c005'>In a listless and disappointed mood, Mark Sutherland
entered the reading-room of the hotel, and, taking up
the daily papers, began to look over their columns, to
see if any new want of a clerk or an agent had been
advertised, which might hold out the hope of employment
to him. At last, in the Intelligencer, his eye
lighted upon an advertisement for a classical and
mathematical teacher. The candidate was required
to produce the highest testimonials of character and
competency, and requested to apply through the office
of that paper. Mr. Sutherland’s classical and mathematical
attainments were far above mediocrity, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>the references he could give were unexceptionable.
He felt therefore certain of being able to offer more
than an equivalent for the salary. He saw, too, that
the office of a teacher, by leaving him many hours of
the day, and the whole of Saturdays and holidays free,
would afford him ample leisure for the pursuit of his
legal studies.</p>

<p class='c005'>He called for writing materials, and immediately
wrote and mailed a letter of application. He was
scarcely anxious about the result—only a little interested
to know whether he should get the situation,
and what sort of a one it would be, when it was got;
whether it would be the place of assistant in a public
academy, or that of tutor in a private family; also,
whether his temporary home should be in the cold
North or the sunny South, the populous East or the
sparsely-settled West, or in the indefinite country
between them; lastly, with what sort of people he
should find himself.</p>

<p class='c005'>But, upon the whole, he scarcely hoped to get a
response to his application, as the paper containing
the advertisement was several days old when he first
saw it. Therefore, when days passed into weeks, and
weeks became a month, he gave up all hopes of obtaining
an answer, without much disappointment.</p>

<p class='c005'>At length—as generally happens after expectation
sickens and dies, and is buried—the unlooked-for
letter arrived. It contained a proposition from Colonel
Ashley, of Virginia, to engage Mr. Sutherland as
private tutor, to prepare his two younger sons for the
university, offering, in remuneration, a very liberal
salary, and requesting, in the event of Mr. Sutherland’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>acceptance, that he would reply promptly, and follow
his own letter in person as soon as possible.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mark sat down and wrote at once, closing the contract,
and promising to be at Ashley by the first of
March.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was now near the last of February. He sold his
horse, paid his bill at the hotel, and having money
enough remaining to take him to Virginia, left the
same afternoon by the steamboat up the river, and
met the stage at Wheeling. After two or three days’
travelling upon the turnpike road, through the most
sublime and beautiful mountain and valley scenery in
the world, he arrived, late one evening, at the little
hamlet of Ashley, situated in a wild and picturesque
gap of the Blue Ridge.</p>

<p class='c005'>Here, at the little inn, he ordered supper, and purposed
to spend the night. But he had scarcely entered
the little bed-room allotted to him, with the intention
of refreshing himself with ablutions and a
change of dress, before the head of the host was put
through the door, and the information given that
Colonel Ashley’s carriage had come to meet Mr.
Sutherland, and was waiting below. He finished his
toilet, however, before leaving his room.</p>

<p class='c005'>He found the parlour occupied by two boys, of
about thirteen and fifteen years of age, disputing the
possession of a pistol, which, in the wrestle that ensued,
went off—harmlessly. And before Mark could
reprove them for their imprudence, they came to meet
him. The elder lad, cap in hand, inquired, respectfully—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Are you Mr. Sutherland, sir?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, my son; have you business with me?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>“Father has sent the carriage for you, sir—that is
all. My name is Henry—he’s Richard. St. Gerald,
you know, is in Washington. He is in Congress, you
know, and has made a great speech—father says, one
of the greatest speeches that has been made since”—</p>

<p class='c005'>“<em>Oh, sho!</em> He’s a great deal older than we are,
Mr. Sutherland; and he’s only our half-brother besides.
<em>You</em> don’t know every thing,” said the younger
boy Richard, addressing the last phrase, accompanied
by a punch in the side, to his brother.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am happy to meet you, Henry—how do you do,
Richard?” said Mr. Sutherland, giving a hand to
each of the boys.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And so,” he added, smiling to himself, and at
them, “this new star of the Capitol—this eloquent
and admired St. Gerald Ashley—is a relative of
yours?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Our brother,” said Henry.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Our <em>half</em>-brother,” amended Richard, favouring
his senior with another malicious punch in the ribs.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hereupon another scuffle ensued, which Mr. Sutherland
ended, by saying—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Come—shall we go on to Ashley Hall, or will you
take supper first, here, with me?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Take supper first here, with you,” assented the
boys, who could have been tempted by nothing but
the novelty to forego their father’s sumptuous supper-table
for this poor tavern meal.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It was kind to come and meet me. But how did
you guess that I should arrive <em>this</em> evening?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, we did not guess. Father thought it about
time you should come, and he sent the carriage, and
intended to send it every stage-day until you <em>did</em> come,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>or write, or something. Father would have come
himself, only he staid home to read St. Gerald’s great
speech.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“St. Gerald” was evidently the hero of Henry’s
worship.</p>

<p class='c005'>While they supped, their horses were fed and
watered. And, half an hour afterwards, Mr. Sutherland
and his pupils entered the carriage, and were
driven to Ashley Hall. It was quite dark when the
carriage drew up before the door of a large, rumbling
old building of red sandstone, scarcely to be distinguished
from the irregular masses of rock rising behind
and around it. A bright light illumined the
hall, where the travellers were received by a negro
man in waiting, who would have conducted them into
a drawing-room on the left, but that Henry and
Richard, breaking violently forward, threw open the
door upon the right, exclaiming—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Father is here. He is come, father! We found
him at the village.”</p>

<p class='c005'>A genial wood fire blazed and crackled in the wide,
old-fashioned chimney of this room; and near it, in
an easy chair, beside a candlestand, sat an old gentleman,
engaged in reading a newspaper. No whit disturbed
by the boisterous onslaught of the boys, he
calmly laid aside his paper and stood up—an undersized,
attenuated old man, with a thin, flushed face,
and a head of hair as white and soft as cotton wool.
He stood, slightly trembling with partial paralysis,
but received Mr. Sutherland with the fine courtesy of
an old-school gentleman.</p>

<p class='c005'>The boys hurried about their own business.</p>

<p class='c005'>The man-servant placed an arm chair for Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>Sutherland. And when the latter was fairly seated,
the old gentleman resumed his own seat, and inquired
whether his guest had supped. Being answered in
the affirmative, he nevertheless ordered refreshments
to be served there.</p>

<p class='c005'>A stand, with wine, sandwiches, cake, and fruit was
placed between them; and while they discussed these,
the old gentleman, in an indifferent sort of manner,
said—</p>

<p class='c005'>“By the way, Mr. Sutherland, have you seen Monday’s
paper, with the debate on the tariff? Here it
is; take it—look over it. Never mind me, I would
prefer that you should see it now. If any thing <em>strikes</em>
you, just read it aloud, will you?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mark took the paper, but found the “debate” to be
all on one side, and in the mouth of one individual,
to wit—the Hon. St. Gerald Ashley, of Virginia. He
ran his eye over it—the old man fingering cheese and
crackers, and pretending to eat, not to interrupt him.
“Do you wish me to read this <em>debate</em> aloud, sir?” asked
Mark, benevolently inclined to indulge the aged
father’s pride.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, yes,” said the old man, smiling, nodding,
and crumbling soda crackers; “yes, if it will not
tire you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, by no means,” answered Mark; and forthwith
began.</p>

<p class='c005'>The celebrated speech was, indeed, a master-piece
of legislative oratory; and Mark Sutherland was an
admirable elocutionist. He read, became deeply interested
and absorbed, and before long was betrayed,
by the old man’s enthusiasm and his sympathy, into
declamation, interrupted now and then by Colonel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>Ashley’s exclaiming, “<em>That’s</em> it! hear, hear. <em>That
must</em> have brought down the House! I wonder what
the Democrats will find to say to <em>that</em>!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Finally, laughing at the fever into which he had
worked himself and his hearer, Mark finished the
speech, and laid down the paper. It was time—it was
past eleven o’clock—late hours for country people,
and far too late for the aged and infirm.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Thank you, sir. Thank you. You have given
me a treat. It was as good as if I had heard it spoken,”
said the old man, flushing with pride and pleasure.
Soon after, he rang for night lamps, and a servant to
show Mr. Sutherland to his room.</p>

<p class='c005'>Early next morning, Mark Sutherland arose and
left his bed-room. The family were not yet stirring;
none but the house servants were about. And with
the restlessness of a heart ill at ease, he walked out
upon the piazza, to find diversion from the bitter retrospections
of the past, and gloomy forebodings
of the future, in the novel aspect of the country
around him.</p>

<p class='c005'>To one used to the undulating, luxurious beauty
of southern scenery, there was something startling
and inspiring in the abrupt, stern, rugged, yet vigorous
and productive aspect of this mountainous region.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Ashley plantation filled the whole of a small
valley, shut in between two curving spurs of the
Alleghanies, and watered by a branch of the Rappahannock.
The Ashley house, an irregular but massive
building of red sandstone, was situated at the foot of
the mountain; behind it arose hoary rocks, intermingled
or crowned by dark evergreens of pine and
cedar; before it, at some distance, flowed the branch:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>around on every side within the vale were gardens,
shrubberies, orchards, wheat and corn fields; and here
and there, picturesquely placed, or half concealed by
trees or jutting rocks, were the negro quarters; while
more conspicuously, in the midst of the open fields,
stood the barns and granaries. Altogether, the plantation,
occupying the whole valley, and completely shut
in by mountains, was an independent, isolated, little
domain in itself.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now, upon the second day of March, the grass
along the margin of the branch was already fresh and
verdant, and the wheat fields sprouting greenly. The
morning was very bright and fresh, and Mark walked
into the garden that lay to the left of the house.
There he found three or four negroes, under the direction
of the gardener, engaged in clearing up beds,
tying vines, trimming trees, and repairing arbours
and garden seats.</p>

<p class='c005'>This place had not the luxurious beauty of the
south, nor the fresh and vigorous life of the west; yet
there was a solid, jolly, old homeliness about it, very
comfortable even in contrast to those other scenes.
Mark felt this, while alternately talking with the old
gardener or contemplating the old home.</p>

<p class='c005'>He was interrupted by an irruption of that Goth
and Vandal, Henry and Richard Ashley, who, rushing
upon him, seized the one his right hand and the
other his left, and boisterously informed him that
breakfast was ready, and had “been waiting ever so
long.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He returned their vehement greeting good-humouredly,
and accompanied them into the house, and to
the breakfast table, which was set in the old oak
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>parlour where he had passed the preceding evening.</p>

<p class='c005'>Two ladies, in simple, graceful, morning dresses
of white cambric, sat near the fire, occupied with a
little delicate needlework; Colonel Ashley stood with
his back to the chimney, with <em>the</em> paper in his hand,
and talking to them about <em>the</em> speech.</p>

<p class='c005'>On seeing Mr. Sutherland, the old gentleman immediately
stepped forward, welcomed him, and conducted
him to the ladies, saying, “My dears, this is
Mr. Sutherland; Mr. Sutherland, my”——</p>

<p class='c005'>But before another syllable was spoken, the elder
lady had lifted her face, started up with a blush of
pleasure, and extended her hand, exclaiming—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mark Sutherland! Is it possible!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mrs. Vivian! Miss Vivian!” exclaimed Mark,
extending a hand to each, impulsively.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why, how strange that we should meet here!”
said Valeria.</p>

<p class='c005'>“A most pleasant surprise, indeed!” responded
Mark.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The surprise as well as the pleasure is mutual, I
assure you! But how did it happen?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am sure I do not know.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nor I. Can <em>you</em> guess, Rose?” and Mrs. Vivian
turned to her step-daughter, who remained silent, with
her fingers in the unconscious clasp of Mark Sutherland’s
hand.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I inquired only in jest, but now I really do believe
you could tell us something about this,” persisted the
lady, looking intently at the maiden.</p>

<p class='c005'>Rosalie’s pale face slightly flushed; she withdrew
her hand, resumed her seat, and took up her work.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>Colonel Ashley, if he <em>felt</em>, certainly <em>expressed</em> no surprise
at this re-union; but as, with stately courtesy,
he handed his niece to the head of the table, said,
“As Mrs. Vivian arrived only yesterday afternoon,
and retired at once to rest from the fatigue of her
journey, and as Mr. Sutherland reached here last
night, there has been no time for conversation about
our arrangements.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ah, yes; that’s all very well; but you’ll never
make me believe that Rose is not at the bottom of
this, somehow,” laughed the widow, shaking her jetty
curls as she sat down at the table. Her eyes met
those of Rosalie for an instant, and the spirit of mischief
was quelled. She became silent on that topic,
and soon after changed the subject, entering into gay
conversation about St. Gerald Ashley and his sudden
fame.</p>

<p class='c005'>When breakfast was over, Colonel Ashley invited
Mr. Sutherland to accompany him to his study, where
he began to unfold his plan for the education of his
boys. After hearing him through, Mark inquired
when he should enter upon his new duties, and requested
to defer the commencement until Monday,
and to use the intervening time to become acquainted
with his home and pupils.</p>

<p class='c005'>The interview then closed. Both gentlemen descended
the stairs. Colonel Ashley told Mr. Sutherland
that he would find the ladies in the parlour, and
then, excusing himself, bade him good morning, and
entered the carriage, which was waiting to take him
to the village.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mark opened the parlour door, advanced into the
room, and before he could retreat, saw and heard the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>fragment of an earnest interview between the mother
and daughter. Mrs. Vivian sat upon the sofa, her
head bent, her jetty curls drooping, her jetty eyelashes
and rosy cheeks sprinkling and sparkling with teardrops,
like morning dew upon a fresh flower. She
was nimbly and nervously stitching away at a piece
of muslin embroidery.</p>

<p class='c005'>Rosalie sat on a cushion before her, with her hands
and her needlework fallen idly on her lap, and her
pale hair fallen back from her paler, upturned brow,
and earnest eyes, that were fixed upon her mother’s.
She was asking in open accents, “Oh, mamma! can
this be possible?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not only possible, but true, Rose,” replied the lady,
dashing the sparkling tears away.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, mamma! do not let him meet such a shock;
prepare him for it, mamma.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I cannot; how could I? Hush—here he is,” said
she, perceiving Mark. And in an instant, presto! all
was changed.</p>

<p class='c005'>Smiling out from her tears, like an April sun from
a cloud, or a blooming rose scattering its dew in the
breeze, she looked up and said, “Come in, Mark;
draw that easy chair up here to the sofa, and sit down,
for I know by experience that men are lazy as the
laziest women.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Sutherland took the indicated seat. Miss
Vivian started from her lowly position, resuming her
place upon the sofa, drawing the foot-cushion under
her feet, and arranging her needlework.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is really surprising that we should all meet
here so unexpectedly in Alleghany county,” said Mrs.
Vivian.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>“I certainly had not anticipated such a pleasure. I
did not know that you were related to Colonel Ashley,
or to any one else in this part of the country.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nor am I. Colonel Ashley is Rosalie’s great
uncle—her mother’s uncle. Colonel Ashley’s last remaining
single daughter was married last year, and
Rosalie was invited to take her abdicated place in his
household. Physicians recommended the bracing air
of the mountains for my delicate girl, and therefore
Rosalie has been living here for the last eighteen
months—ever since we left Cashmere, in fact. Last
winter, I think, was rather too cold for her here on the
mountains. I spent the season in Washington, from
whence I have just returned; but next winter I intend
to take Rose to Louisiana with me, and make an
arrangement by which she can spend all her winters
in the south.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Indeed, mamma, you shall not immolate your happiness
upon my ill health. You shall just spend your
winters in Washington, where you enjoy life so much,
and your summers at the watering-places, where you
meet again your gay and brilliant friends. I shall do
well enough. You shall visit me in the spring and
autumn intervals.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, a truce, Rosalie! We shall be set down as a
model mother and daughter. <em>I</em> know, for <em>one</em>, selfishness
is the mainspring of all my acts. I rather think
I like you, child, and prefer to see you well. There!
I declare there’s Robert with the horses already. Put
on your cloth habit, Rosalie; the morning is really
cold; and don’t let him take you far, child; these
hearty men have very little instinctive mercy for delicate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>girls, and he would not imagine he had tired
you to death till you had dropped from your horse.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Rosalie arose, rolled up her work, and left the
room, nodding and smiling to a young man who entered
as she left. “Mr. Bloomfield,” said the lady,
presenting him to Mr. Sutherland. Mr. Bloomfield
was a sufficiently pleasing specimen of a well-bred,
country beau—moderately tall, broad-shouldered, and
deep-chested—with regular features—fresh, ruddy complexion—clear,
merry blue eyes—and lips, whose
every curve expressed the good humour and benevolence
of a kind, contented heart.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You mustn’t take Rose far, Robert.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I will take her only to mother’s.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And you sha’n’t teaze her with any more nonsense!
I can’t put up with that, you know.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Robert Bloomfield blushed violently, smiled till all
his regular white teeth shone, and was stammering
out a blundering deprecation, when, to his great relief,
Rosalie appeared, attired for the ride. The young
man arose, Mrs. Vivian surveyed Rose, to be sure she
was well defended from the cold, and finally yielded
her in charge of her escort, who bowed and took her
out.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mrs. Vivian and Mark looked at them through the
window, saw him place her in the saddle with more
than polite attention—with a careful and tender solicitude
that made her smile. When they had ridden
off she turned to Mark, and said—</p>

<p class='c005'>“I like that good-humoured, blundering boy. He
has been paying court to Rose ever since she has been
here. He is a young man of independent fortune, irreproachable
character, fair education, and most excellent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>disposition, and he has loved Rose for more
than a year. Yet, with all, he is not worthy of her!
he wants polish—the polish that nothing but intercourse
with refined society can give him. He came
to see me last winter in Washington, got fitted out by
a fashionable tailor, and I good-naturedly took him
with me to an evening party. If ever I do such a
thing again as long as I live may——; but never
mind! Just think, when I presented him to a superfine
belle, of his holding out his hands to shake hands
with her, telling her he was glad to see her, and
hoping that if ever she passed through his part of the
country, she would pay his mother and sisters a visit,
&#38;c. And then, when the elegant Mrs. A. inquired if
Mr. Bloomfield waltzed, just fancy him blushing furiously,
and saying that he would rather not—that he
disapproved of waltzing!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well!” said Mrs. Vivian, looking up, after a
pause.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes—well?” inquired her companion, raising his
eyebrows.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You have not made a single comment upon my
country beau. I see how it is. You’re thinking of
your relatives. Mark, you must question me if you
want me to tell you anything.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My mother”—began the young man.</p>

<p class='c005'>“She is living very comfortably with her husband
at Cashmere.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“With her husband!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Is it possible you did not know she was married,
Mark?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I never knew it—I never dreamed it—I never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>thought it possible.” He looked shocked—he <em>was</em>
shocked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And why not?” asked the lady, with a little
jealous petulance. “Why may not a widow remarry?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nay—I do not know, I’m sure,” said Mr. Sutherland,
with his eyebrows still raised, and his eyes fixed
upon the floor. “My mother married! Will you
please tell me to whom?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“To whom? Oh, of course you know, Mark. Now,
who was it likely to be, but Dr. Wells?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Our old family physician!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why of course. You know he had been pleased
with her a long time.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That my mother should have married!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“She never would have done so, Mark, had you not
left her.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And she is happy, you say?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Comfortable, Mark. Your mother and Dr. Wells
make what Tim Linkenwater calls ‘a comfortable
couple.’”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am not so much grieved as surprised,” said Mr.
Sutherland. And after a short pause he said, “There
was another—my cousin.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The face of the lady grew troubled—she did not
speak.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Is <em>India</em> well?” again spake Mark, in a faltering
voice.</p>

<p class='c005'>“India is well, and beautiful as ever. She was the
belle of Washington last winter—her beauty the
theme of every tongue—the envy of every woman,
the madness of every man. No assembly was complete
without ‘the Pearl of Pearl River!’”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>Mark Sutherland grew pale, and shivered—saying,
“Of course she”——</p>

<p class='c005'>“Among her own sex there was no rival star. She
divided public interest and attention only with St.
Gerald Ashley, that great new planet on the political
horizon.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mark Sutherland’s whole strong frame was convulsed.
He started up and paced the floor in extreme
agitation—then, seizing his hat, rushed out of
the room.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And <em>I</em> was to prepare him for it, said Rosalie!”
exclaimed Mrs. Vivian, looking after him, as the pity
of her heart grew strong.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>In the meantime, the two young riders took their
way up a narrow bridle-path, leading up a long
crooked pass of the mountain.</p>

<p class='c005'>The morning was glistening with brightness and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>freshness, and the mingled joyous sounds of rural life
made music in the air. They rode along awhile in
silence, strange enough in a pair so youthful. At
length the young man broke the spell.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Rose!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, Robert!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I cannot bear this suspense! I cannot, indeed.
Heart and frame are wearing out with it!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Rosalie stole a glance at his clear, bright blue eye,
and round, fresh, ruddy cheek, looking still brighter
and fresher under the glossy, crisp, curling, auburn
hair—and a smile lighted up her countenance.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ah! you may laugh! You have the hardest, the
most unimpressible heart I ever saw in my life! But
good and strong as my constitution is, it will break
down—it will indeed, Rosalie—if you keep this up
much longer. And I wish it <em>would</em> break down! I
do so! Then perhaps you would pity me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But, Robert, my pity would be very poor compensation
for lost health.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t know! If I could make you feel for me
any way, or at any cost, I should be glad.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I <em>do</em>, Robert. I feel a very sincere esteem and
friendship for you. Surely you cannot doubt that.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh! yes, you are good to me to a certain degree.
Your heart is like a peach!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Like a peach!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes; it is superficially soft and impressible, but
the core of it is hard and rough—hard and rough!
Oh, Rosalie, can’t you <em>try</em> to like me a little?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I like you very much without trying!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, you know what I mean, you tormenting girl!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>Can’t you—you—can’t you love me well enough to
be my own? Speak! Answer! Tell me, Rose!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, Robert, how many times have I told you—no?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I—but I won’t take no for an answer! All my
affections and hopes are freighted in you, and I <em>will
not</em> resign you; I <em>will not</em>, Rose. I will go on hoping
in spite of you—hoping against hope! It is <em>impossible</em>—mind
I say <em>impossible</em>—any one loving as I do,
should not win love in return. It does seem to me as
if it would be unjust in heaven to permit it!”</p>

<p class='c005'>He spoke with impatient, passionate vehemence and
earnestness.</p>

<p class='c005'>Rosalie watched and heard him with wondering and
sorrowing interest. She gravely said—</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘It is impossible that one loving so much should
not win love in return,’ you say? Yes, it <em>does</em> seem
impossible, if we did not know it to be often really
possible. It <em>does</em> seem unjust!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You acknowledge it! You own it to be unjust
that I should give you so much—give you <em>all</em>—my
entire heart, with all its affections and hopes—and get
back nothing, <em>nothing</em> in return—or next to it—only
‘esteem,’ forsooth! and ‘friendship!’ That provokes
and exasperates me beyond endurance! Rosalie, I
don’t want your esteem or friendship. I refuse and
repudiate it! I reject and repulse it! I will have
none of it! Give me <em>nothing</em>, or give me your whole
heart and hand!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I would to Heaven I could do it, Robert! I would
to Heaven I could give you my heart. I am ready to
say that if I could, I should then be a happy and
enviable girl, because I believe you a most excellent
young man, whose only weakness is your regard for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>me. But I cannot, Robert. With all my friendship
for you”—</p>

<p class='c005'>“<em>Don’t</em> name it!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I must, Robert! With all my friendship for you,
when you talk of love, my heart grows hard and
cold, and silent as a stone—it has no response for you
at all.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And you say that to drive me out of my senses—to
make me wild!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I say it because it is the simple truth. I am sorry
that such <em>is</em> the truth. I think, with you, it is strange—strange—almost
unjust, that so much priceless love
should be thrown away.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“How cool she is! Good Heaven, how cool
she is!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have a problem for you, Robert; and I want to
see if, with all your mathematics, you can solve it,
and satisfy me as to why there is so much love lost in
this world.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“She can philosophise, too, after her fashion. She
can do anything but love!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Will you solve my problem?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It belongs rather to metaphysics than mathematics,
one would think—nevertheless, state it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Thus, then: A loves B—or rather, to be clearer,
Aaron loves Belinda with a perfect passion; and he
thinks, by reason of its great power, it <em>must</em> win a
response from her. But Belinda involuntarily turns
from Aaron, and fixes her affection upon Charles, who
does not in the least return it. Now, why should
these cross purposes exist? They say that marriages
are made in heaven. I wish the angel that has charge
of them would look into this matter a little.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>She spoke in a light, bantering manner, yet her
voice quivered slightly. She stole an arch glance at
her companion, and said—</p>

<p class='c005'>“There is my problem—solve it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He eyed her closely, jealously.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Are you putting an imaginary case?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nay, answer my question before asking another.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, then, yes! I <em>will</em> tell you how this ought
to end, and how it <em>shall</em> end, too. Belinda will soon
feel it to be unwomanly, indelicate, undignified, to
leave her heart in the possession of one who undervalues
the priceless treasure; she will withdraw it,
and yield it up at the demand of the rightful
owner—of him who <em>justly</em> claims it because he prizes
it above all treasures, and desires it above all possessions!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You think so?” said Rosalie, averting her face,
and bending down, and stroking her horse’s mane.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I <em>know</em> so.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“How do you know it?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Because it <em>ought</em> to be so.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Again—<em>why</em>?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Because <em>man’s</em> love is the conquering love! But
now, tell me—were you putting an imaginary
case?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, I was putting an imaginary case,” she said,
in a low, quiet tone.</p>

<p class='c005'>She drew rein.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What is the matter, Rosalie? Are you tired?
Has the ride been too much for you?” inquired the
young man, checking his horse, and looking anxiously
at her.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>“Yes, I think so,” she answered, wearily.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Rest awhile, and then we will go on.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No—I must go home—the air is very chill,” she
said, shivering.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And you are pale,” he observed, gazing at her
with earnest, affectionate interest.</p>

<p class='c005'>She returned that gaze with a pensive, grateful
glance, saying—“Indeed, I feel I ought to be very
grateful to you for caring so much for a poor, sickly
creature, like me. You in such fine health, too. I
do not understand it. I thought every one preferred
blooming girls; but you attach yourself to poor, pale
me. Dear Robert, believe me, I am very, <em>very</em> grateful
for your love, however this may end. I <em>do</em> wish I
could be <em>more</em> than grateful. Dear Robert, if I could
give you my whole heart as easily as I give you this
rose, I would do it.” And detaching a white rose from
her bosom, she handed it to him.</p>

<p class='c005'>And they turned their horses’ heads, and went down
the mountain path, towards home.</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie Vivian and Robert Bloomfield reached
home just as the carriage containing Colonel Ashley
rolled into the yard. The old gentleman alighted,
greeted the young people with a most cheerful and
kindly smile, and with unusual vigour and lightness
tripped up stairs into the house. His servant, laden
with packets of newspapers and letters, followed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You may take my word for it, Rosalie, that the
Colonel has received some excellent news by this
morning’s mail! And now just observe the power
of the soul over the body! Joyful news will so rejuvenate
infirm old age, that it will skip about, elastic
as youth. Witness Colonel Ashley, who stepped up
those stairs more lightly than I ever saw him move in
my life; while disappointment and sorrow will so enfeeble
youth that it will move about drooping like
paralytic age. Witness me ready to drop from my
saddle with exhaustion—from your unkindness, Rosalie!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am not unkind, nor do you look very much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>prostrated, let me say, Robert! But will you not
come in?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No,” mournfully replied the young man, assisting
her to alight.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You had better—we have strawberries for the
first time this spring.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nonsense!” exclaimed Robert, with an offended
air.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Strawberries from uncle’s premium conservatory,
and cream from my own premium dairy; you had
better think it over!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nonsense!” exclaimed Robert, contemptuously.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, <em>then</em>, there’s no more to be said, of course!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Good morning, Rosalie!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Good morning, Robert; but won’t you shake hands
with me?” she asked, offering her hand. He seized
that little hand, and squeezed it and pressed it to his
lips, and with an expression of curiously-blended deprecation
and reproach, dropped it, mounted his horse,
and galloped away.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mrs. Vivian was standing dawdling with a white
rose in the piazza. She came forward, with tender
care, to meet Rosalie. “Did you ride far—are you
tired, love?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not very.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But you look pale and wearied.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“A moment’s rest will restore me, dear mamma.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Come in and sit down, while I take off your
things,” said the kind little lady, leading her stepchild
into the parlour. She sat her down in a deep-cushioned
chair, rang the bell, ordered a cordial, and
then removed her hat and riding skirt. When she
had made Rosalie take a cracker and a little glass of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>anise-seed cordial, and when the salver was removed,
and they were left alone, Rosalie reclining upon the
sofa, Valeria sitting in the easy chair near her, the
lady inquired—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why did not Robert come in?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I do not know, unless it was because he did not
wish to do so.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Have you quarrelled?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Quarrelled! Dear mamma, I never had a quarrel
with any one in all my life, and never expect to have
one with anybody—least of all with Bob.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That is no reason you should not have a lover’s
quarrel—<em>they</em> befall the most amiable pair. Is it so?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What, mamma?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Have you and Robert had a ‘lover’s quarrel?’”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, indeed—I assure you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yet Robert went away offended—‘in dudgeon,’ as
uncle would say.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Rosalie looked distressed. The lady eyed her searchingly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Rosalie, will you let me speak to you frankly, and
ask you a few questions?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Certainly, dear mamma; I would turn my heart
inside out, and show you its most hidden secret, if it
had any secrets.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, then, are you and Robert engaged?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, mamma.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“He has not yet proposed, then?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I scarcely know, mamma, whether I ought to reveal
poor Robert’s confidences.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, mamma!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You did not reject him?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>“Yes, madam.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m astonished! How long ago has this been?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dear mamma, twelve months ago Robert first did
me the honour of offering his hand, and I gratefully
declined it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yet continued to keep his company! Oh, Rosalie!
Well, has he ever renewed his proposals?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, mamma, several times.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And you have continued to reject them?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Of course, mamma.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And yet you still accept his attentions! Oh,
Rosalie!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Was I—am I wrong, mamma?” asked Rosalie,
looking up from where she reclined upon the sofa.</p>

<p class='c005'>The lady sat with her hands clasped upon her
knees, in a simple attitude, with her eyes fixed in
sorrowful doubt upon her child.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Do you ever mean to review your decision, and
accept him, Rosalie?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Never, mamma, I assure you!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Are you very certain, Rosalie?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Certain, dear mamma, beyond all possibility of
doubt.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“If I could believe it”——</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dear mamma, you may rest assured of it! Why,
if I thought it was to be my fate to marry Robert
Bloomfield, well as I like him, I think I should die
of grief!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And yet you keep his company! Oh! Rosalie, I
am surprised.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Is it not right, mamma?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What a simple question! Oh, child! if it were
not you, I should say it is unprincipled!”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>“Mamma, you distress and alarm me! Why must
I not keep poor Robert’s company, when he takes so
much comfort in my society?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Comfort! Does he take comfort—do you call it
comfort? No, Rosalie, it is a feverish, consuming
hope that keeps him at your side; a wasting, baleful
hope, which, since you do not intend to realize to
him, it is your bounden duty to extinguish forever!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mamma! I do not quite understand you. I am
sorry, very sorry, that I cannot return Robert’s regard”——</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh!” exclaimed the lady, interrupting her, “I
am not sorry for <em>that</em>: as to <em>that</em>, I am very glad
you are not engaged to him, nor ever likely to be;
but”——</p>

<p class='c005'>“But why add to the grief of rejection the bitterness
of ingratitude and coldness?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“To refuse his attentions, to deny him your company,
would not be either the one or the other, and
it is your duty.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“When poor Robert has no consolation in the
world but my company”——</p>

<p class='c005'>“To say he has no other intoxication, would be
nearer the truth. Rosalie, you are so young, so delicate,
so <i><span lang="fr">spirituelle</span></i>, so inexperienced. Rosalie, there is
a kindness that is cruel, and that is what you have
been showing ‘poor Robert’ all this time. And there
is a cruelty that is kind, and that is what you must
show him now.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mamma, if you think it wrong, I will never ride
with him again.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And avoid him as much as possible, Rosalie.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>“Indeed I will, mamma. Poor Robert!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Fudge! It will not hurt him. The flame without
fuel will soon expire harmlessly.”</p>

<p class='c005'>By this time the young girl had quite recovered
from her fatigue, and she arose and left the room, to
prepare her strawberries, she said.</p>

<p class='c005'>She passed into a pleasant back room, connected
with the pantry and dining-room, but opening upon
the garden, and devoted to certain light dessert preparations;
such as the shelling of peas, stoning of
cherries, &#38;c. It was a cool apartment, with a bare,
white oak floor, and many doors and windows open,
and looking out upon the pleasant garden, with its
budding spring flowers—its roses, hyacinths, and
daffodils—and upon the orchard, with its peach trees
and cherry trees, covered with pink and with white
blossoms, and further off, upon the green and dewy
wheat field, lying in fertile dales between gray and
mossy rocks and mountains. It was indeed a pleasant
apartment, looking out upon a fresh, verdant, rural
scene. Rosalie sat down in the midst of the room,
with a basket of fresh strawberries on her right hand,
an empty basket to receive the caps on her left, and
a cut-glass dish on her lap. She chose to do this.
She had a decided attraction to these little graceful
domestic avocations; and as her nimble fingers
capped the strawberries, and dropped berries in the
dish, and threw caps in the basket, she began to sing
some lively rural glee; and while she was busily
engaged, singing and capping, she chanced to look
up, and saw Mark Sutherland approaching the house
from the garden. He met her glance, and smiled. She
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>was in a merry mood, or she would not have felt free
to say to him what she did.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Come in, Mr. Sutherland; I have got something
for you, very nice!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mark came in, and she said, “Make a bowl of your
joined hands, now, and here!”</p>

<p class='c005'>She poured into his hands some fine large strawberries,
adding,</p>

<p class='c005'>“These are the first fruits of the season, Mr. Sutherland,
and we offer them to you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Let me first merit them, by helping you,” said
Mark.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Will you help me?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Certainly; that is, if I am not intruding on some
housekeeping sanctuary.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, no! this room is open and common to the
whole family; why, it is the pleasantest room in the
house, only as it is near the pantry and dining-room,
and opens upon the kitchen garden, we prepare our
fruit, and sometimes pick over our vegetables here.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Sutherland drew a chair on the other side of
the strawberry basket, and went to work—nobody
could tell why—actuated by some whim, no doubt.
After a little desultory conversation, Mr. Sutherland
said,</p>

<p class='c005'>“I believe, dear Rosalie, that I owe this situation
to your friendly remembrance, and I have been waiting
some hours for an opportunity of expressing my
thanks.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Rosalie’s face flushed to the temples.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am deeply obliged and grateful to my fair
patroness.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The blush deepened, crimsoning her face. She
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>waved her hand deprecatingly, impatiently; she began—“Mr.
Sutherland”—and stopped, as it were, choked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Miss Vivian, are you so unwilling to receive my
acknowledgments? Then must my gratitude be
silent, but not the less deep.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Again she essayed to speak, and the words came
vehemently, impetuously.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I had no agency in procuring this situation for
you, Mr. Sutherland. How could you think for a moment
that <em>I</em>, or any one else, could presume to ‘patronize’
<em>you</em> in such a manner? How could you suppose,
for an instant, that I, or any one else that knew
you, could deem this position a fit and proper one for
you? No! could I have dared to interfere, it would
have been to prevent your coming here.”</p>

<p class='c005'>There was a tone of honest, earnest indignation in
her voice, looks, and manner, that utterly astounded
Mark Sutherland. Could it be that she thought him
unworthy of the position? No; he dismissed that
surmise at once, and answered, quietly,</p>

<p class='c005'>“I confess you surprise me, Rosalie! Is not the
vocation of a teacher really honourable, if conventionally
humble?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is greater, higher, more difficult, more responsible,
than any other, except that of the preacher of
the Gospel!” answered the girl, earnestly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What is the matter, then—am I unfit for it?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, you are totally unfit for it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why?” smiled Mark; “has my education been
neglected?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I know that you are a distinguished classical and
mathematical scholar, Mr. Sutherland; and for any
other branch of knowledge quite fitted to take a professor’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>chair; but to be a teacher of youth requires
other and rarer qualifications, which you have not.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“To wit?” inquired Mark, much amused with his
young mentor.</p>

<p class='c005'>“First, then, you should have a natural vocation
for teaching, and consequently the love of it, which
you have not; a great deal of affection for children,
which you have not; much patience, perseverance,
firmness, social humility, some of which qualities you
have, and others you have not.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am tempted to ask you to specify which I have
and which I have not, but I will not.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I thought you were going to open a glorious
career for yourself, and achieve a great name.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“In what manner?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I thought you were going to be a statesman.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“A <em>lawyer</em>, child.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why are you here, then, Mr. Sutherland? Why
are you not a lawyer?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Rosalie, I made an effort, many an effort, to get
admitted to practice, at the bar of S——. I had
thought myself well qualified, for I had studied legal
science with what you call an attraction—a vocation
for the profession. For several years past I had read
law <i><span lang="la">con amore</span></i>; yet, through the want of familiarity
with the technicalities of practice, I failed to get admitted
as a practitioner before the court.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then I would have gone into some lawyer’s office,
and assisted him as a copyist for nothing, until I had
acquired an intimacy with those crabbed technicalities.
It seems to me such a very trivial matter for an impediment.
Why, there is your uncle, who is no lawyer,
but who can draw up a right legal and binding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>document, with as many ‘whereases’ and ‘aforesaids’
as ever made a composition unintelligible.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My dear Rosalie, that would have been a very
small beginning.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘Despise not the day of small things,’ said the wise
man. And at least the lawyer’s office would have
been in the way of your genius; and to have entered
it in the capacity of copyist would have been much
better than to have turned into this by-path, which is
utterly apart from it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“There were difficulties in the way of even that,
Rosalie.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And even if there <em>were</em> difficulties, what then?
We have no royal road to distinction in our country.
We have no ready-made great men. None are ‘born
great;’ none have ‘greatness thrust upon them.’ If
any would be great, he must ‘achieve greatness.’
Nearly <em>all</em> of our heroes and statesmen have struggled
up from the humblest places in society—have struggled
up, alone and unaided, until they have proved
their mettle; and the struggle has been wholesome
for them, and has turned them out sound and healthful
natures.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You speak wisely and truly, dear Rosalie; yet
each of all these men to whom you have alluded, had
near and dear friends—mother, sisters, a wife, perhaps—to
watch his career, and rejoice in it—to soothe
him in moments of exasperation, from injustice, from
opposition, from persecution, and to encourage him in
hours of depression and despondency, when all his
hopes and energies seemed palsied, and the wheels of
life and action seemed clogged and stopped; and,
finally, to share and enjoy his success, and to glory in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>his triumph. Oh, believe me, Rosalie, man cannot
work for himself alone! It were a low and selfish
aim!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But he can work for humanity—he can work for
God!” said Rosalie, in a low and reverent voice.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mark Sutherland sat with his eyes fixed upon the
ground, in deep thought. Rosalie continued—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Attain a position, Mr. Sutherland—such a position
as the prophetic voice in your heart foretells. Win
fame! not for yourself, but for men and God! not for
your own aggrandizement, but for the <span class='fss'>POWER</span> to right
the wronged, to raise the fallen, to deliver the oppressed,
to redeem the evil, to speak with <span class='fss'>AUTHORITY</span>
the truth to men and before God! Labour, wait,
struggle, for such a position, and, though no mother,
sister, wife, or love, smile on your career, men and
women will know it! God will bless it!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mark Sutherland still remained buried in deep and
silent thought upon her words. Oh, if <em>India</em> had so
spoken to him, so sympathized with his aspirations,
so encouraged his flagging hopes and energies, what
might he not have accomplished, even before this!
But this child Rosalie was nothing, and yet she spoke
words of high moment, and spoke them “as one having
authority.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You astonish me, Rosalie; you talk far beyond
your years and sex; you really astound me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I wish I could convince you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You do, you do, my child. But, Rosalie, how is
this? You must have reflected very much, for one
of your tender years.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am not so young; I am seventeen.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“A venerable age, indeed. But, Rosalie, how is it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>that you have thought so much beyond girls of your
age?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Have I done so?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why, assuredly—do you not know that you have?
Now tell me how it is.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, if it is so as you say—for <em>I</em> do not know and
cannot judge of young people, having never had any
young companions—I suppose it is because I have
been always sickly, and have always led an isolated,
meditative life; hearing in my secluded retreat only
the loudest thunders of the distant great world of
society, I have naturally thought most about its great
successes, and how they were accomplished. I have
watched from afar the career of living great men, and
have secretly made unto myself idols like them. I
have read with deep interest the lives of distinguished
statesmen and heroes, particularly those who have
struggled up from poverty and obscurity; that is the
reason.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yet that is very unusual in so young and beautiful
a girl. I cannot yet comprehend it—I can scarcely
believe in it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The pleasures of childhood and girlhood were not
for me—there was nothing left but books, and much
thought over needlework, in solitary hours. Please
do not give me undue credit; it is more mortifying
than blame. I must tell you how it was I thought so
much of your life. Nearly two years ago, after you
made such a vast sacrifice to principle—giving up
wealth, station, popularity, family, friends, love, esteem,
<em>all</em> for your ideas of duty—hero-worshipper that
I was, I recognized in you the elements of which
heroes are made, and”——</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>She blushed, and suddenly stopped, conscious of
the indelicacy of praising him to his face.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Go on, dear Rosalie.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Still she remained silent and embarrassed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, Rosalie, you saw, or rather you <em>thought</em> you
saw, in me the elements of heroism?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It was very impertinent in me to presume to say
so—forgive it!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nay, dear child, I beg you won’t take it back!
If you do not hope for me, who will?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Indeed, I do hope for your success very strongly—and
more than that, I count upon it very confidently”——</p>

<p class='c005'>“But finish what you were going to say; you saw
in some one ‘the elements of which heroes are made,
and’”——</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, nothing, only I dived more deeply than ever
before into my lives of great men, and reflected more
than ever upon the causes that made them great, if
you do not think it presumption in a girl like me to
talk of reflection upon such a subject. But my mind
ever had an attraction to it, and you gave that attraction
a new and strong interest. I thought of you,
and hoped that you were on the road to an honourable
and beneficent distinction. I was grieved to
hear that you were coming here; I would have
opposed it, had I dared. Do not stay here, Mr.
Sutherland.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I must fulfil my engagement with your uncle!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My uncle will release you from it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yet, dear Rosalie, I cannot leave now.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Do not think me importunate, impertinent; I
wish you would go even now to-day.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>Mark Sutherland looked up at her in surprise, but
checked the answer that rose to his lips, when he saw
her troubled face. Her work being now completed,
she arose, and left the room.</p>

<p class='c004'>For the next several days, various notes of preparation
as for some joyful coming event, were sounded
through the old hall. Servants, within and without
the house, pursued their avocations with unusual alacrity.
Waggons, with new furniture, arrived from a
neighbouring town. In the drawing-room and parlours,
Mrs. Vivian directed the operations of the upholsterers,
in putting down new carpets, and hanging
new curtains, mirrors, &#38;c. On the lawn, and in the
garden, Rosalie’s taste presided at the trimming and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>dressing of vines, shrubs, and flowers; while from one
to the other Colonel Ashley flew with a gay, busy interest.
They were all evidently playing the prelude
to some great family festival. Mark Sutherland remained
unenlightened upon the subject, until, one
morning, as he walked out upon the piazza, to enjoy
the early freshness of the air, he was joined by the two
lads, Henry and Richard, who, seizing each a hand,
eagerly inquired—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Are you going to walk out this morning, before
breakfast, Mr. Sutherland?”</p>

<p class='c005'>A nod and smile was his answer. He was depressed,
despondent; he felt that he had no part in
all that was going on in that house—he felt himself a
stranger and an alien. Yet, too generous and benevolent
to damp the spirits of the lads by his own
gloom, he smiled upon them kindly, and when they
asked permission to accompany him, he inquired,
gaily, how it happened that, while all were so very
busy, in the house and on the grounds, they alone
should be idle.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, Mrs. Vivian drives us out of the way—even
Rose won’t let us help her, and father threatens to lock
us up if we don’t keep quiet. We’re driven about
from post to pillar; and so we came out to walk with
<em>you</em>. Father and the rest of them making such a fuss!
just as if nobody ever got married before St. Gerald!”
said Richard, contemptuously.</p>

<p class='c005'>Another might have rebuked the boy for speaking
so disrespectfully; but Mark had little of the tutor
spirit in him, after all. Rosalie was right in that.</p>

<p class='c005'>They left the piazza, crossed the lawn, and took the
narrow path leading along the course of the stream-the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>boys sometimes affectionately holding his hands,
and sometimes one or the other suddenly breaking
away to pluck and bring him an early violet, or
eglantine rose, or to throw a pebble in the stream,
where some small fish had started up. At last—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Making such a fuss!” again complained Richard;
“making such a fuss, and driving us about so that we
boys can’t have a bit of peace of our lives! Just as
if <em>she</em> were so much better than everybody else in the
world, that so much trouble must be taken for <em>her</em>.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whom are you talking of?” inquired Mr. Sutherland,
carelessly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why the young lady St. Gerald is going to marry,
to be sure!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ah, then, Mr. Ashley is going to bring home a
wife, is he?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why, <em>of course</em> he is!” said Henry, warming up.
“He is going to be married to a beautiful young
lady, very rich, who was the belle of the city last
winter, they say!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, she is as rich and as beautiful as a princess in
a fairy book; and that’s what all the fuss is about,”
sneered Richard.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t you mind Rich, Mr. Sutherland; he can’t
bear to have a word said about anybody but himself!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“As if I wanted anybody to bother themselves
about me—I’m not so much like <em>you</em> as <em>that</em>,” retorted
Richard. And thereupon arose the usual squabble between
the lads, until their tutor interfered and restored
order, if not good feeling.</p>

<p class='c005'>They continued their walk for about a mile along
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>the mountain stream, and then returning by the back
hills, got home at the breakfast hour.</p>

<p class='c005'>Colonel Ashley, Mrs. Vivian, and Rose, were already
seated at the breakfast table, and engaged in
eager conversation concerning the approaching marriage
of the heir of the house, when Mr. Sutherland
and the lads entered.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Good morning, Mr. Sutherland. I hope you have
had a pleasant walk—though I would not be bothered
with those troublesome boys, if I were you; their company
is quite enough in school hours, I should think!”
said the old gentleman, banteringly, as they took their
places at the board.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mrs. Vivian and Rosalie smiled a salutation. And
then the thread of the conversation was taken up
again, as if it had never been broken, and as if
Mark Sutherland was already familiar with the premises.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes; St. Gerald writes me that the marriage will
come off at an early hour of the day, and that immediately
after the ceremony they will set out from
Washington for this place. It will take them two
days to reach here, so that we may expect the party
on Thursday evening. Rosalie, my dear, bear that
in mind, if you please, and be ready. Mrs. Vivian,
my dear lady, I do not want <em>two</em> cups of chocolate
at once—this, I think, is intended for Mr. Sutherland!”
said the old gentleman, passing the cup to
Mark.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mrs. Vivian’s mind was certainly absent and distracted,
as her manner was disconcerted, and her
beautiful countenance troubled.</p>

<p class='c005'>After breakfast, the family party separated as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>usual. Colonel Ashley went to his study, to write
letters; Mrs. Vivian and Rosalie to their work-table,
in the parlour; and Mark to his school-room, with
the boys.</p>

<p class='c005'>The ladies had scarcely seated themselves, before a
servant entered to say that Mr. Robert Bloomfield had
come with the ponies, and wished to know if Miss
Rosalie would ride.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t go, Rose; send an excuse. Cut this companionship
firmly and kindly off, at once and forever,”
said Mrs. Vivian, in a low voice.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Tell him, William, that I am very much obliged
for his kindness, but I cannot ride to-day,” said
Rosalie, and, as the servant left the room, she added,
“That was a very unkind, ungrateful message,
mamma.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nonsense! What kindness or gratitude do you
owe to Robert?” answered the lady, with an apparent
harshness of sentiment that her heart did not by any
means justify.</p>

<p class='c005'>But, before Rosalie could reply again, Robert
Bloomfield entered the room, flushed and in haste;
and, without even seeing Mrs. Vivian, hurried up to
the young girl, exclaiming—“Rose! Rose! how <em>is</em>
this? Three times I have called here, as usual—as a
matter of course—to ride with you, and each time I
have been met by your servant, and told—I don’t
know what, except that I could not see you, Rose.
Dear Rosalie, have I offended you in any way? Dear
Rosalie, speak to me! Say! Say, are you angry
with me?” he persisted, seeing that she did not
answer.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>“Now, what on earth should I be angry with
you about, Robert? Of course, I am not angry.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You are offended with me. You are, I feel
you are—I know you are; I see it in your face,
Rosalie,” he persisted, gazing on her troubled countenance,
and reading, but not aright, its sorrowful expression.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Indeed, I am not displeased with you, dear Bob.
How could I possibly be, when you never in your life
gave me cause for any other feeling towards you than
esteem and thankfulness?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘Esteem and thankfulness!’ I told you before,
Rosalie, if you persisted in talking that way you’d
drive me out of my senses!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Here Mrs. Vivian hemmed, to give notice of her
presence; and Robert Bloomfield turned, and perceived
her for the first time. If he had not observed
the lady before, he did not care about her now. He
bowed; and then, forgetting her, turned, and resumed
his conversation with Rosalie, in the same impatient,
impassioned tone.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mrs. Vivian, with a cold, offended air, arose and
left the room. But as soon as the door closed behind
the lady, and Robert found himself alone with Rosalie,
he certainly betrayed a great sense of relief, for his
manner became more earnest and vehement, and he
pleaded anew the hopeless suit so often and so decidedly
rejected. His tongue was loosened, and words
flowed, without let or hindrance, in that impetuous
torrent of eloquence inspired only by passion; and
Rosalie listened with emotion scarcely less than his
own, for every word he uttered gave expression to the
vague, deep, unspoken yearning of her own heart.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>She heard him out patiently; yes, she let him begin
again, and go over the whole matter a second and
a third time, before she could find courage to destroy
his hopes. At last she said—</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have deeply wronged you, Robert. I did not
mean it, Heaven knows; but I <em>have</em> wronged you.
Robert, I am very sorry. I shall never forgive myself.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t understand you, Rosalie—I—<em>do</em> tell me
what you mean!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I mean that I have not been frank enough with
you, Robert. I have not had the courage,” said Rosalie,
in a faltering voice, for she still deeply pitied him.</p>

<p class='c005'>He did not look like an object of pity, just then; all
his countenance suddenly brightened with joy. He
seized her hand, exclaiming—“Do I comprehend? Do
I hear you right? Do you mean, after all, that you
like me a little better than you said you did?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No. Oh! Robert, what a sanguine nature yours
must be, to interpret every word which is not positive,
in your own way. No, Robert! I mean, that I have
thoughtlessly accepted all your kind services, knowing
full well that I never, never can repay the smallest of
them. I mean, too, that I have let you tell me, again
and again, of your regard, knowing all the while that
I can never, never return it in the way you wish. I
have wronged you, by not telling you this with sufficient
firmness before!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Cruel! cold! hard! heartless!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is my misfortune that I cannot accept you,
Robert. My reason is telling me all the time, just as
any prudent old lady could tell me—that if I <em>could</em>
like you, I should have an enviable lot in life; not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>because you are wealthy, and all that, of course,
Robert, but because I really do know you are—so
good, so disinterested, so true, and because your dear
mother and sisters are just like you, and I could love
them as if they were my own relatives.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“In mercy, Rosalie, why do you talk to me so, if you
never mean to accept me?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why, indeed? Because I cannot reject this kindness,
for which I am indeed most sincerely grateful,
in any other but the humblest manner, and with every
circumstance to assure you, that I feel how much good
I reject in rejecting you, Robert. Dear Robert, there
is certainly destiny, as well as duty, in these matters;
and, well as I like you, I could not love you enough
to marry you, if my salvation depended on it; indeed
I could not. I am not destined to so easy a life,
Robert. I begin to have a foreshadowing that my lot
will be a very rough one, Robert; that I shall not be
left to bask in the sunshine, but shall have to face and
weather the storm.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You—you fragile snow-drop! What do you mean
now? <em>You</em> meet the storms of life! Has the Planters’
Own Bank broken, or have all the slaves on the
plantation run off in a body?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Neither one nor the other, Robert. And if I
‘rough it’ in the world, it will be my own free choice.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I confess I do not understand you—except that
you make me wretched; that is plain enough, but as
to the rest, I am all in the dark.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is my own secret, Robert.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“One thing I do know; that is, you are too delicate
for a rough life.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Robert, there are many delicate natures that have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>been cherished, and nursed, and petted to miserable
weakness and death. My flower garden has taught
me that lesson.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I should like to know how a flower garden could
teach you a lesson like <em>that</em>!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh! should you? I can tell you, then. Last
year, when I came here, I found a new flower growing
in the garden. I don’t know botany, and I don’t
know what the flower was, or how it came there; but
I suppose the wind brought the seed. My flower was
so feeble and withered, that it had lost all beauty and
comeliness, and every charm, except a delightful
odour. I weeded and worked around it, and watered
it regularly, and nursed and cherished it, but it faded
faster and faster, yielding a dying fragrance. I said
it was too exposed and cold, and I took it up and
transplanted it to the conservatory. There it wilted
and fell, and I gave it up for lost. But now mark the
sequel. A few days after, I took a ride up to the
mountain top, and left my horse, for a ramble on foot.
A fresh, delicate, delicious odour greeted me. I
looked about, and lo! there, in a cleft of the rock on
the mountain top, where it would be exposed to all
the snow, and wind, and hail of winter, and burning
rays of summer, was my strange hothouse plant! There
it grew and flourished, swaying to and fro in the wind,
and filling all the air with the freshness of its fragrance!
Now what do you think I did, Robert?
You will laugh at me, of course, for everybody
laughed. The very next day I took my poor flower,
that was dying in the conservatory—and that I pitied
as if it had been a sick, caged bird—and I carried it
up the mountain, and planted it in the evening.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>Thunder gusts and showers the next day prevented
my ride; but the third day I visited my protege. It
was living! It had plucked up a spirit and intended
to live. I am like that plant, Robert! And now, to
come back to yourself. We must part, Robert, as
friends—kindly—but not to meet again, except as
mere acquaintances, until you have outgrown the
present weakness of your heart.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She extended her hand—he pressed it to his lips,
seized his cap, and hastily left the house.</p>

<p class='c004'>The day at length came upon which St. Gerald
Ashley and his young bride, with their attendants,
were expected to arrive at Ashley Hall. Early in the
afternoon, the carriage had been sent to the village
to meet them; and in the evening all the members of
the family were assembled in the drawing-room, to
await them. Many of the country gentry, who had
been invited to meet the bridal party, had joined
the circle in the course of the evening, and the rooms
were now quite full. Among the guests present were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>the Right Honourable W—— R——, then Governor
of the State; Judge M——, of the Supreme Court;
and a few others, high in state or national authority,
whose distinguished names are now historical. But
there was no one present so proud or happy as old
Colonel Ashley, who walked about gently rubbing
his hands, in the simple gleefulness of his country
heart and habits.</p>

<p class='c005'>The carriage was behind time; for the reason, it
was rumoured, that the bride and her attendants chose
to rest an hour or two at the village. At length,
however, the welcome wheels were heard to roll up
to the door, and the travellers to alight and enter the
hall. They retired to change their dresses before
entering the drawing-room. In the meantime, among
the country neighbours in the saloon, all was half-subdued
excitement and expectancy. Among the company
was Mark Sutherland, of course. He was not
one to shade with his dark brow the brightness of
other people’s gaiety. In the social temper of youth,
he had sought to enter into the spirit of the time, and
had laughed and jested with the young people, or
“talked politics” with the elders, as the case demanded.
He had heard the slight, subdued bustle in
the hall, incident upon the arrival of the bridal party;
and the instant absorption of the whole heart of the
assembled company, in the interest of the moment,
had left him free. He had stood a few moments quite
alone and unobserved, when a slight tremulousness of
the air near him, a slight disturbance of his own
serenity, caused him to look up.</p>

<p class='c005'>Rosalie Vivian was standing near him, with a deprecating,
imploring look and gesture. Her face was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>white as the white crape dress she wore, and her
wreath of snow drops quivered with the trembling of
her frame.</p>

<p class='c005'>Startled by her appearance, he asked hurriedly—“Dear
Rosalie, has anything happened? What is the
matter?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I ought to have told you before! <em>Some</em> of us
ought to have told you! <em>I</em> ought to have done so!”
she answered, somewhat vaguely and wildly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Told me <em>what</em>, dear Rosalie? What is it?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Give me the support of your arm into the next
room—there is no one there.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My child, you are not well!” said Mark, looking
at her now with painful anxiety, as he drew her hand
through his arm.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am not <em>good</em>, you ought to say. I have not been
good! I have been a coward! I have not been your
friend, Mark! I have been a traitor.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“A traitor! Rosalie, you rave!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I ought to have told you any time this month
past; but I could not <em>bear</em> to do it. And now it is
scarcely any use at all; it is a mockery to tell you.
But yet, indeed, I could not bear to see you standing
there, so gay and unsuspicious. I could not bear to
think how you would lose your self-command in <em>her</em>
presence. No, I could not endure the thought, Mark!”
she said, more and more incoherently.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Rosalie, you are very nervous; you have over-excited
yourself about this wedding. Come, let me
get you something,” said Mark, drawing her gently
through the crowd.</p>

<p class='c005'>As they passed, the buzz of conversation increased
very much, and “They are coming;” “The bride is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>coming;” “There she is;” “Hush,” &#38;c., were the
sounds that heralded the entrance of the bridal party,
just as Mark Sutherland led Rosalie Vivian into the
next room. He took her to a sofa, seated her, handed
her a glass of water; but she waved it aside, saying,
“I do not need it—I do not need it! It is <em>you</em> who
need strength and calmness now. O, Mark! I wish
you had left the house when I advised you to leave it!”
she exclaimed, her agitation becoming momentarily
greater. At last, forcing herself to speak again, she
asked: “Mr. Sutherland! Mark! Do you know
the name of the lady whom St. Gerald Ashley has
married?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Certainly,” said Mark Sutherland, raising his eyebrows
in an interrogative manner.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You do!” exclaimed Rosalie, greatly surprised—excited.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Certainly I do! How could I possibly remain in
ignorance of it?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You do! You know it! And yet you are so calm!
Nay, indeed, I am afraid you are mistaken; whom do
you suppose it to be?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“One once betrothed to myself—my cousin India!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You know it! And you are not unhappy about
it! Oh, blessed Lord! I am so thankful—so glad!”
And Rosalie dropped her face upon her hands, and
wept softly and quietly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dear Rosalie, has all this disturbance of yours
been caused by your sympathy with unworthy me?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I remembered how you suffered at Cashmere—I
feared—I dreaded if you met her suddenly here—the
bride of another—that”——</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, dear Rose! That”——</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>“Oh, I fear you think me very impertinent. If
you do, you may tell me so; indeed, I shall not take
it amiss.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Tell me your thought, Rosalie. Was it that all
those old wounds would be re-opened? That all those
sufferings would be renewed?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yet you see that they are not.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, thank Heaven, Mark! But I cannot understand
it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, then, understand it now. The advent of my
promised bride, as the wedded wife of another, does
not disturb a pulse of mine, because, in <em>my</em> heart—in
any honourable heart—love could not long survive
esteem, more than it could survive hope or duty, and
because”—— Here his whole manner grew most
earnest, most intense, and passing his arm over her
shoulder, he drew her face towards his own, and
kissing away the tear drops from her eyes, said, “Because
I love this single tear of true feeling better than
the whole heart of yonder selfish beauty!”</p>

<p class='c005'>And now, if Mark fancied tears, he might have a
plenty of them; for now they fell warm and fast.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What is the matter, Rosalie? Why do you weep
now?” asked Mark.</p>

<p class='c005'>But she did not answer. He repeated the question
perseveringly.</p>

<p class='c005'>At last, sobbing softly, and smiling, and sighing,
and blushing, and averting her face, she said, archly,
“Juliet wept at what she was ‘glad of.’”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Are <em>you</em> glad, Rosalie? Tell me, dear Rose. Are
<em>you</em> glad that I love you more than all the world that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>I have chosen you the guiding star of my
life?”</p>

<p class='c005'>She did not, could not answer.</p>

<p class='c005'>He repeated this question, also searchingly, perseveringly,
only to hear her answer; and he bent his
ear, and averted his eyes, and quelled the beating of
his heart, to win her reply.</p>

<p class='c005'>At last it came, with her face hidden on his shoulder,
and in a tone scarcely above her breath—“I always
hoped you would like me at last; I did not think you
would so soon, though.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But are you glad—are you <em>glad</em>?” persisted the
unreasonable man.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, <em>glad</em>,” whispered Rosalie; and in proof of
her truth the tears rolled quietly down her face.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And so am I! Glad, happy, hopeful, confident,
Rosalie! There will be no more faltering, and fainting,
and failing now! You have infused new life into
me. That any gossamer girl should have the power
to do this! Yet such is the case, Rosalie.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Am I such a gossamer?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You are very fragile, Rosalie.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘Out of the heart are the issues of life.’”</p>

<p class='c005'>They were interrupted, of course; people always
are when they are very blessed. It does not suit “the
rest of mankind” to leave them so. This time it was
old Colonel Ashley, who really was happy enough in
himself to have left Mark and Rosalie alone in their
content, if he had known it. He came in with a
brisk step, with his slight figure seeming slighter, his
grey hair lighter, and his thin, rosy face fiercer than
ever, with the effervescence of his joy. He advanced,
speaking—</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>“Ah, Mr. Sutherland, you are here! I have been
looking for you. What! will you be the last to pay
your respects to the bride, and she a relative—though
a very distant one, I suppose, of your own? Come,
let me present you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Does India—does Mrs. Ashley expect me?” inquired
Mr. Sutherland.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I imagine not!” replied the old gentleman, raising
his eyebrows; “but that does not matter, you know.
Come!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Pressing the hand of Rosalie, before relinquishing
it, Mark Sutherland arose to accompany Colonel Ashley
to the front drawing-room, and to the presence of
the bride.</p>

<p class='c005'>They could not at once approach her, on account
of the number of persons around her; yet the room
was not so thronged with company as to prevent their
having a full view of the bride and her attendants.</p>

<p class='c005'>There stood India receiving the homage of her
circle—her superb form arrayed in the rich and gorgeous
costume that was so well adapted to her majestic
and luxurious style of beauty. Her cheeks
were mantled with a rich, high colour, yet this seemed
not the carnation bloom of youth and health, but the
fire of a feverish excitement. Her eyes were dark
and brilliant, yet not with the light of innocent love
and joy, but with the blaze of a burning and consuming
heart.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Come,” whispered the old gentleman; “it is no use
to stand here waiting our opportunity; for we might
stand all night, and those fools wouldn’t give way.
Poor wretches!—just like boys peeping at a gentleman’s
conservatory, where they know they dare not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>touch even a rose-bud. Come, we must elbow through
that circle of dandies; gently, you know—gently.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And suiting the action to the words, Colonel Ashley
adroitly insinuated himself through the outer
crowd and through the nearer circle, and into the
very presence of the bride.</p>

<p class='c005'>She was not looking towards the new-comers. She
was listening to a gentleman, who, having apparently
exhausted all other subjects of adulation, was now expatiating
upon the rare and exquisite beauty of the
bouquet she held in her hand.</p>

<p class='c005'>Colonel Ashley and Mr. Sutherland were before
her.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mrs. Ashley”——</p>

<p class='c005'>She looked round.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Will you permit me to present to you my young
friend, Mr. Sutherland—a distant relative of your own,
may I hope?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mark Sutherland looked up, caught her eye, and
bowed deeply. But before he had had time to do so,
before even the deliberate ceremonious presentation
speech of the old gentleman was half over—at the
very instant she had turned around, and her eye had
fallen upon Mark Sutherland—a change, an appalling
change, had come over her lovely face and form, like
that which might be supposed to sweep over the face
of some beautiful and fertile oasis at the sudden blast
of the simoom, that buries all its luxurious beauty in
the burning and arid sands of the desert.</p>

<p class='c005'>As by the sudden smite of death, all colour was
dashed out from her cheek, and all light from her
eye. For a moment she stood and gazed, transfixed,
unable to withdraw her stony eyes from his; then,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>with a sudden cry, as if some tightly-strained heartstring
had snapped—the tension of her form relaxed,
and she fell to the floor!</p>

<p class='c005'>In an instant all was confusion. Raised in the
arms of her father, Clement Sutherland—who, until
that moment, had remained obscure in the background—the
swooning bride was borne into the adjoining
room, and laid upon the sofa, while restoratives
were anxiously sought for, to be administered.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the meantime, in the saloon she had left, only
two persons—Mark Sutherland and Mrs. Vivian—understood
the cause of her fainting. Various innocent
conjectures prevailed, far from the truth. “It was
the heat of the room,” thought one; “Over-excitement,”
opined another; “Standing so long,” fancied a
third; “The fatigue of her journey,” imagined a
fourth. “Really, it was too inconsiderate in Colonel
Ashley to oblige his daughter to receive company
upon the very evening of her arrival,” complained
Mrs. Chief Justice M——, a large, heavy person, fanning
herself slowly. “I noticed her face was very
pale,” said a sympathetic lady, drawing upon her imagination
for her facts. “Indeed! but I thought it
was very flushed,” interrupted a matter-of-fact individual.</p>

<p class='c005'>All these various conjectures were expressed in
low, almost inaudible tones; while, undisturbed and
smiling, Mrs. Vivian passed among the company, and,
as it were, moved upon the troubled waters of their
half-suppressed excitement, and, with her mere smile
of self-possession, restoring calmness and order.</p>

<p class='c005'>Presently the door of the inner room opened, and
the bride reappeared, leaning lightly upon the arm of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>her father, and attended by her husband and bridesmaids.
She entered, and passed up the saloon to her
former position. Several country gentlemen zealously
drew forward a cushioned chair, and several sympathetic
old-fashioned ladies approached, with inquiries
and expressions of condolence.</p>

<p class='c005'>Pale and weary, but smiling and self-possessed,
Mrs. Ashley gracefully accepted the services of the
former, and replied to the interested questions and
comments of the latter.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It was very ill-judged on the part of the Colonel,
my dear, to subject you to the fatigue of a reception,
just off your journey—very indeed,” said Mrs. Chief
Justice M——.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I do really think we ought to exercise the good
taste of retiring,” whispered another.</p>

<p class='c005'>Whether India heard this remark or not, she answered—</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am not fatigued. We made but a very short
stage to-day, and rested several hours at the next village.
No; it was the warmth and closeness of the
room. The windows are open now, and the effect
has gone with the cause,” she added, smiling brightly,
while at the same moment the consciousness of the
first falsehood she had ever uttered in her life brought
a warm though transient blush to her cheek, that resembled
the returning glow of strength, and reassured
all doubt.</p>

<p class='c005'>After a little, the musicians began to touch their
instruments, and soon struck up a lively quadrille air.
The younger portion of the company gave signs of
restlessness. Gentlemen hesitated, and then chose their
partners for the set, and remained awaiting the motions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>of Mrs. Ashley. As hostess, it was her right to
select any gentleman present to honour with her hand
for the quadrille; and as bride, it was her privilege to
lead off the dance.</p>

<p class='c005'>When India became aware that all were waiting for
her, she threw her eyes over the assembly; and the
aspiring heart of many a youth beat faster when their
beams lingered for an instant on him. But he for
whom she looked was nowhere to be seen. At last, a
smile of scorn and <em>self-scorn</em> writhed swiftly athwart
her lips, and her eyes suddenly blazed as their light
kindled upon the form of one who came in at the
farthest door. Quick as lightning flashed and fled the
spasm of that face, leaving it serene and smiling, as
she arose and met the new-comer, and said sweetly—</p>

<p class='c005'>“My cousin Mark, will you honour me?”</p>

<p class='c005'>And before the astonished man could bow, she had
placed her hand in his, and he found himself by her
side, at the head of a set that instantly formed around
them.</p>

<p class='c005'>India spoke and smiled with her usual charming
ease, and danced with her usual grace and dignity.</p>

<p class='c005'>And after the dance was finished, and her partner
had led her to her seat, she detained him near her,
toying with her fan or bouquet, talking of a thousand
nothings. She presented him to her husband; and
Mark Sutherland, of course, politely expressed himself
pleased to form the personal acquaintance of one
with whose public life and services he had been so
long familiar, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c005'>Throughout the long evening, India maintained a
regnant self-control. And Mark Sutherland wondered
at the seeming inconsistency of her conduct. He did
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>not know, or he did not reflect, that in the first instance
of surprise, her <em>nerves</em> had—so to speak—got
the start of her <em>will</em>, and so betrayed her; but that
after once the will had regained the ascendancy over
the nerves, it was able to control them.</p>

<p class='c005'>Not again that evening did Mark Sutherland find
an opportunity to speak with Rosalie. India detained
him at her side, smiling, chatting, and in her daring
audacity carrying back their recollections into scenes
and times and places that suggested the parallel of
taking lighted candles among open casks of camphine
or gunpowder. Her indifference was too well attested
to be genuine. But Mark Sutherland’s perfect calmness—real
and thorough, as hers was assumed and
superficial—assisted her.</p>

<p class='c005'>The drama of the evening was at last over. The
company had departed, the lights were out, and India
found herself, for a few moments, alone in her
chamber. She had smiled, and glanced, and chatted,
and charmed all eyes and ears to the last. She had
gained the privacy of her chamber—she had angrily,
then fiercely, rejected the services of her attendant,
and turned her from the room. And now, for the
moment, she was alone and free—the acting all was
over—the mask might be laid aside—the miserable
victim of pride might seem the wretch she really was.</p>

<p class='c005'>And oh! the fearful change that came over that
beautiful but agonized face when the mask of smiles
fell! She threw herself, all robed, and gemmed, and
wreathed, as she was, prostrate upon the bed—her
form convulsed, her bosom heaving with the suffocating
anguish, which, from its very excess could not
be vented.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>“False! false! false!” she wailed. “False to Mark!
false to my husband! falser than all, to myself! Lost!
lost! lost! Lost, body, soul, and spirit! Would that
I could die!”</p>

<p class='c005'>A light, gay footstep on the stairs, a low, love-tuned
voice near the door, and it opened, and St. Gerald
Ashley entered, with a smile of confiding affection on
his noble face.</p>

<p class='c005'>How will that erring woman meet his manly, trusting
love?</p>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie’s content was undisturbed and perfect.
She had not witnessed India’s fainting. She knew
of it, but ascribed it, as others did, to fatigue, heat,
and over-excitement. She never once associated the
swoon of the bride with the meeting with her former
lover. It is true she had dreaded this meeting, for
the sake of Mark, who, she feared, still cherished an
affection for India; but she had no such fears for her.
She could not have imagined—the simple integrity
of her heart shielded her from imagining—that India
could have given her hand to one man, while cherishing
a thenceforth guilty preference for another. Of
course, she had heard and read of ladies who desecrated
marriage by making a legal sale of themselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>for money, rank, or convenience; but then such were
ladies of society, ladies of the great world—not highhearted
women, not women of noble <em>sentiments</em>, like
her friend India, who, if she were fickle, was at least
truthful, even in her fickleness. No; the thought of
India, while the wife of another, still loving Mark, and
fainting at his sudden appearance, never entered the
girl’s mind. She heard and entirely believed India’s
own explanation of her swoon—“the closeness of the
room”—and so, undisturbed by the suspicion of that
suffering near her, which, had she known it, would
have greatly troubled her peace, Rosalie yielded up
her soul to serene joy. That night in her prayers she
returned earnest thanks for the happiness accorded
her. She sought her pillow in the fulness of content.
Mark loved her! beyond this, she did not care to ask
or hope any earthly good. Mark loved her! this was
happiness enough for one long season. Mark loved
her! the thought enveloped her soul in a benign sense
of perfect protection, safety, and comfort. Mark loved
her! the thought was perfect peace. Wrapped in it,
she sweetly fell asleep.</p>

<p class='c005'>She awoke in the morning, with a vague impression
of a great happiness sleeping in her heart. Suddenly,
with a shock of electric joy, she remembered what it
was—Mark loved her! Again, in her morning worship,
she offered up fervent thanksgiving for this
priceless boon of love; and after she had made her
simple morning toilet, she left her room, and went
down stairs. Her self-assumed domestic duties claimed
attention; but still the light of her inward joy brightened
all her countenance.</p>

<p class='c005'>Colonel Ashley, always an early riser, was in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>hall when she descended. He met her, smiling. She
was smiling, too.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, my bonny girl!” he said, “spite of late
hours, our mountain breezes are beginning to make
the roses bloom on your cheeks. You look very
pretty this morning!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well,” said Rosalie, “how long am I to keep the
keys, or when am I to deliver them up to <i><span lang="fr">Madame
l’épouse</span></i>?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ah! I don’t know. How should I? You must
settle that between you. In a few days, I suppose.
Ask your pretty little mamma; she is likely to know
such points of domestic etiquette. Madam does not
look very much like the material of which Virginia
housewives are composed, I must say. I fear, little
girl, that you will still have to carry the keys.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now, you know, uncle, if I am to have all the
duties of housekeeper, without the dignities of mistress,
I intend to demand a salary for my services. Do
you hear?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And you shall have it, my dear—ten kisses a day.
Will that suit you?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Rosalie laughed and left him.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was yet early in the morning, and she went to
“see after” breakfast. Her first visit was to her diary,
to have the new milk strained, and the old milk
skimmed, and the cream and butter iced and brought
out for breakfast. Then she sent two little negro girls
into the garden, to gather raspberries—a necessary
luxury in its season on a country breakfast table.
Then she went into the cellar, to select the fresh fish
and game and oysters that had been kept in ice.
Then went to the pantry, to give out coffee, tea, chocolate,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>sugar, &#38;c. Then to the plate and china closet,
to “parade” the best Sevres breakfast service and the
family plate, in honour of the occasion. Her next
visit was to the breakfast room, to see that the table
was well arranged. “I wonder, after all, if India <em>will</em>
like to spend two hours of the early morning in this
manner, instead of lounging them away over her own
elegant toilet,” said Rosalie to herself, as she passed
into the room. Finding all in order here, the busy
little housewife passed next into that pleasant room
near the kitchen and the pantry, and fronting upon
the garden, and devoted to the picking of vegetables
and fruit, and such little half-horticultural, half-culinary
pursuits. Here she found her two little black
handmaids, with their baskets of raspberries, waiting
for her. She praised their diligence and took the
raspberries, and was engaged in putting them in cut-glass
dishes, and powdering them with sugar, when
she felt a light hand laid upon her shoulder, and,
glancing around, she saw Mark Sutherland standing
behind her, smiling upon her. A sudden bright
blush suffused her beautiful countenance; but she
exclaimed, saucily—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not even the grace of Paul Pry, to say, ‘I hope I
don’t intrude.’”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You know you gave me the freedom of this room
long ago, little housekeeper.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“A privilege which men like you seem inclined to
abuse,” answered Rosalie, glancing at her gingham
gown, holland apron, and turned-up sleeves.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Beautiful in that also, Rosalie. What a charming
little peasant you make!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I think so too,” said Rose, ingenuously; and then,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>blushing and laughing, she suddenly corrected herself,
saying, “<em>Oh!</em> I did not mean <em>that</em>; I meant I like
this dress and this occupation, and think they suit me
perhaps as well as any other.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Shall I help you with this also, Rosalie?” said
Mark, taking up a sugar-duster.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, no, thank you! I have nearly done. If you
want employment, you may go into the garden and
select a bouquet of the sweetest half-blown white rose
buds and heliotrope that you can find, as a morning
offering to our bride.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And for you, a posy of heartsease,” he answered
meaningly, pressing her fingers as he went.</p>

<p class='c005'>Rosalie finished her fruit, ornamenting the edges
of the dishes with fresh green leaves, and sent them to
the table. Then she went and changed her dress for
breakfast; and when Mark returned from the garden,
he found her standing in the hall waiting for him.</p>

<p class='c005'>She was looking very lovely, in her fresh white
muslin morning dress, without any ornament, but her
own soft brown ringlets, and the bright blush and
smile lighted by happiness.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Here they are, sweetheart!” he said, gaily and
fondly showing the flowers.</p>

<p class='c005'>“An elegant bouquet for the bride!” she exclaimed
admiringly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And a sweet little posy for you,” he said, placing
the heartsease on her bosom.</p>

<p class='c005'>“<i><span lang="fr">Il est a propos, n’est ce pas?</span></i>”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is fit.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“<i><span lang="fr">Oui! Comme il faut, Monsieur?</span></i>”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is faultless.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>“Do you mean to say you won’t talk French with
me, Mark?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I mean only to show you, as long as you speak it
to me, that there is not a word or phrase in that fashionable
and hackneyed language, that has not a shorter,
stronger, and more expressive synonym in our own
mother tongue. There is no language for true thought
and strong feeling like our earnest English. But, my
Rose! even English has no word to tell how much I
love you—how dear you are to me! All last evening,
occupied, monopolized as I was, sometimes for a
moment I would forget you, and then your image
would return to me with—how shall I say it?—how
express it?—with such a thrill of life and joy as I
never felt before; an emotion purer, higher, more
blissful than I ever knew before. But, Rose! my
rose! will this dream fade also? Must I wake, to find
that you cannot go with me through the rough paths
of life, up which my footsteps have to toil?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, Mark! No—unless you will it so. Believe in
me, for I am true. ‘Whither thou goest, I will go; and
where thou lodgest, I will lodge; thy people shall be
my people, and thy God my God; and the Lord do so
to me, and more also, if aught but death part me and
thee,’” she said earnestly.</p>

<p class='c005'>There was earnest honour as well as deep affection
in the broken words wherewith he blessed her, as he
led her back into the parlour where all the family
were now assembled.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>It was impossible that the discordant elements of
social life assembled at Ashley Hall could harmonize
for an instant. Of the family party gathered around
the breakfast table, the pale, beautiful India assumed
a mask of smiles—Mr. Ashley wore a look of anxious
perplexity he did not care to hide—Mark Sutherland
appeared self-possessed, but was too conscious to feel
really at ease. Colonel Ashley was secretly annoyed,
to find the re-union around the breakfast table not
quite so cheerful as might have been expected. Mrs.
Vivian was vexed at the general tacit antagonism, and
resolved, if this should last, to bring her visit to a
close as soon as possible. Nevertheless, she kept up
an irregular fire of wit and repartee, to prevent the
party falling into dead silence. Rosalie alone was
truly at ease. She was totally ignorant of any cause
of disunion in the circle, and too much absorbed in her
own infinite content, to notice signs of disturbance
among those around her.</p>

<p class='c005'>When breakfast was over, the little lady drew
Rosalie off into the piazza, and away up to the honeysuckle-shaded
end, where no one was likely to come
but the honey bees.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And now, Rose,” she asked, “what is it? Your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>eyes have poured streams of light all breakfast time,
like sun glances; they have projected rays wherever
they have fallen. Now what is it all about?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“One should be merry in wedding times!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Merry in wedding times! Look here, Rosalie!
Some marriages are made in heaven, some on earth,
and some—<em>in the other place</em>. But it was not merriment,
but profound, still joy, that lighted your eyes,
Rose! Now, what was it all about?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mark loves me, mamma!” whispered the girl,
hiding her face upon her step-mother’s shoulder.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now, that’s the most absurd thing I ever heard
in all my life!” exclaimed the little lady, shoving her
off, and walking rapidly away with a highly-flushed
cheek.</p>

<p class='c005'>Rosalie knew her too well, and trusted her too
thoroughly, to feel any anxiety. She walked behind
her, put her arms around her waist, and, bending forward,
looked up smilingly into her eyes.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You needn’t think to get the better of me that
way, Rose! It is ridiculous, I say! What do you
mean to do with this love?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Rose folded both hands over her bosom with a look
of unspeakable content. Both look and gesture were
involuntary.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Aye, hoard it away, treasure it deep in your
heart, I suppose you mean. Silly girl! Well, what
is to be the end of it all? What practical object do
you propose to yourself? When ever do you expect
to be <em>married</em>?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whenever Mark asks me, mamma!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is just madness!” exclaimed the lady, impatiently;
“he has not a dollar!”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>“Yes, he has! All that I have, mamma!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“All that you have! Do you imagine for an instant
that your guardian will give up one cent of your
property during your minority? No; he will even
stop your allowance if you become the wife of Mark
Sutherland!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why should he do that? It would be very
unjust!” said Rosalie, raising her eyebrows with
surprise. “It would be unnatural! monstrous! My
guardian, Mark’s own uncle! Oh! surely, having
discarded him, he will not pursue him with persecutions.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“<em>Will he not?</em>”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, I will never believe it!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“He will fill up the measure of his animosity—believe
that! Clement Sutherland did not appear at the
breakfast table this morning. Can you not surmise
the cause? He has many bad reasons for hating his
nephew. He hates him for his political opinions, for
his principles, and, more than all, for having had the
power to give up the beautiful India. Clement Sutherland
worships his beautiful daughter; and he hates
Mark for not having laid upon her shrine the most
precious jewel of his soul—his integrity. And now,
with the opposition of your guardian, who is invested
with such power over your fortune, what have you to
expect in giving yourself to Mark Sutherland?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I do not know; I shall leave it all to Mark. It is
no conditional promise I have given him—no halffaith
I have pledged him. I have given him the full
and complete control of my destiny. I could not
help it. All that was within me—heart, and soul,
and spirit—sprang to him when he called me. Mamma,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>it is a word often abused, but at this moment my
soul throws it irresistibly upon my lips—I <em>adore</em> Mark!
And now, amidst opposition, persecution, desertion,
he must know that there is one who will follow wherever
he leads—one heart that will cleave to him, in
joy and in sorrow, in life and in death.”</p>

<p class='c005'>At that very instant the boy brought the mail-bag,
intruded upon them, and handed Mrs. Vivian a letter.
As soon as her glance fell upon the superscription,
her face flushed to the forehead, and, for the moment
forgetful of Rosalie, she hastened to read it.</p>

<p class='c005'>While this confidential conversation was going on
between the young step-mother and her daughter,
another scene, portentous with fate, transpired in the
study of Colonel Ashley. As that gentleman was
leaving the breakfast-room, a message was brought
him from Mr. Clement Sutherland, desiring the favour
of a few moments’ private conversation with him.
Colonel Ashley returned word that he would be pleased
to see Mr. Sutherland in his study. Thither he immediately
proceeded, and thither soon followed his guest.</p>

<p class='c005'>Clement Sutherland entered, with a forbidding and
foreboding scowl upon his brow.</p>

<p class='c005'>Colonel Ashley instantly arose, set a chair, and invited
him to be seated.</p>

<p class='c005'>Clement Sutherland, without unbending the sternness
of his features, bowed, and sat down.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I trust you are in good health this morning, Mr.
Sutherland,” said the Colonel, urbanely.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am well, sir,” replied his guest, coldly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I was sorry to miss you at the breakfast table this
morning. I trust my little girl made you comfortable
in your own apartment?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>“Thank you, sir.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Colonel Ashley was silenced and repelled for a little
while by this churlishness on the part of his interlocutor;
but, speedily recollecting that it was his guest
who had sought this interview, he inquired with some
reserve of manner—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Can I be so happy as to serve you in any way this
morning, Mr. Sutherland?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Who recommended that young man whom you
have engaged as a tutor?” asked Clement Sutherland,
curtly.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now, Colonel Ashley might well have been provoked
by the abruptness of this question to make
some unpleasant answer, but Colonel Ashley was a
gentleman and a host. He replied with the utmost
courtesy, yet in a manner that administered the keenest
and most delicate rebuke. Looking at his guest, he
said, slowly and with meaning, “His <em>name</em> recommended
him, Mr. Sutherland.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That is just what I feared. That is the one thing,
unhappily, of which we cannot deprive him, and
makes us, in some degree, responsible for him. Pray,
sir, did you know anything of this young man’s past
history?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nothing.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You fancied him a relative of ours?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Certainly.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now, then, will you be so kind as to give me your
attention for a few minutes?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Colonel Ashley settled himself in an attitude of fixed
interest, and Clement Sutherland commenced a narration
of some considerable length, which, at its close,
left Mark Sutherland with the character of a graceless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>son, a faithless lover, an unprincipled man, and a mad
reformer.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Sir,” said he, in conclusion, “you should not give
him house-room for an hour! He will pervert your
children, steal the heart of your niece, sow fatal dissension
between your son and his wife, and incite your
servants to revolt!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Colonel Ashley went through all the degrees of
incredulity, doubt, perplexity, and alarm, exclaiming,
“I should never have believed it of him! He does
not look at all like an incendiary!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Sir, an incendiary does not parade his combustible
matter before your eyes, and <em>look</em> like he was going to
fire your house!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“He does not seem to me to be at all dangerous.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Sir, dangerous people never <em>seem</em> dangerous.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I rather liked the young gentleman, I confess,”
said Colonel Ashley, slowly and hesitatingly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Sir, would you like your children to imbibe revolutionary
principles? Would you like your servants
incited to revolt? Would you like an estrangement
and separation brought about between your son and
daughter-in-law? Would you like your niece to elope
with a fanatic?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mr. Sutherland, I must say that you shock me
beyond endurance. You ruthlessly grasp subjects
that a man of honour and delicacy scarcely likes to
touch. You have dealt severely with the young man,
also, in your speech. He may be an enthusiast—enthusiasm
is a fault appertaining to youth and genius—and,
moreover, persecution is not at all to my taste;
it is always the growth of cowardice. I am as far
from the spirit of persecution as I am from the spirit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>of fear. I do not <em>fear</em> that my children will be perverted,
my negroes maddened, my niece infatuated, or
my son and his wife divorced, by the presence of this
high-souled but mistaken young gentleman in my
family. I told you that I liked Mr. Mark Sutherland,
and I cannot hate him to order. Nevertheless, as it
is not expedient that one formerly betrothed of Mrs.
Ashley should be here to annoy her by his presence,
I will see the young gentleman, and arrange the speedy
termination of our engagement.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Clement Sutherland expressed himself satisfied,
arose and left the room.</p>

<p class='c005'>Colonel Ashley remained with his head upon his
chest, in an attitude of serious thought, for a few
minutes; then, pulling the bell-rope, he summoned a
servant.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Go,” he said to the man that entered, “and request
Mr. Mark Sutherland to favour me with his company
here for a few moments.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The messenger went out, and in search of the tutor.</p>

<p class='c005'>Meanwhile, Mark Sutherland was in his own room,
engaged in reading a letter that had arrived by the
morning’s mail. It was from his old college friend,
Lauderdale. It was a very long letter, being the first
that he had written to Mark Sutherland for more than
two years. He began by reproaching Mark for
dropping the correspondence, and leaving him in ignorance
of his whereabouts. He next informed his friend
that he owed his knowledge of his present residence
to a happy accident—namely, to information given
him by a fair lady with whom he had been so fortunate
as to maintain an epistolary correspondence; that he
expected soon to arrive at Ashley Hall, on a visit to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>this fair friend, from whom he had received an invitation.
(Here a jealous pang shot through the heart
of the reader.) “A fair friend”—might that be Rosalie?
Had <em>she</em> kept up a constant correspondence with
Lauderdale? And had she even invited him to the
house? He could not endure the suspicion for a
moment. No, not even if it were only a cool, friendly
correspondence. He could not endure that Rose
should be on friendly terms with any man except
himself. He read on. The letter proceeded to tell
him all that had befallen the writer since he had last
written; how he had settled in a Western country
town; how, after some difficulty, he had been admitted
to the bar, and how he had already got into a tolerably
lucrative practice. Finally came the most startling
news of all—viz., that two months previous, he—L.
Lauderdale, Esq.—had come into the possession of
an estate of sixty thousand dollars, by the demise of
his godfather, a widower without children or near
relatives, and who, dying, bequeathed to him the
whole of his considerable property. “I do not fully
realize this event, dear Mark,” he wrote; “I cannot
realize my personal interest in it. All I <em>do</em> feel—but
that is much, that is everything—is that now I may
go to Ashley Hall, and lay myself and my fortune at
the feet of my fair friend, the beautiful widow, Mrs.
Vivian.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mark took a long, deep breath.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What do you want, sir?” he said, looking up, and
for the first time seeing Colonel Ashley’s servant
standing in the room.</p>

<p class='c005'>The man delivered his message, and Mark promised
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>to attend Colonel Ashley soon, and dismissed the messenger.</p>

<p class='c005'>He resumed his letter. There was little more to be
read, but that little was full of fate.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It matters not to me, now, dear Mark, what
quarter of the country I live in. That shall be decided
by the will of my fair queen, Valeria. One
thing is certain—this ‘law shop’ and this village must
be given up. My evacuation of the premises will
leave a fair opening for any enterprising young gentleman
who may choose to fill it. What say you?
If you are still ‘seriously inclined’ to the ingenious
profession of the law, let me know. If you are disposed
to step into my shoes, you will find them not
much worn, with not even the gloss off, only the creak
and harshness taken out of them a little. Think this
over, so as to be able to give an answer, by the time
I see you. You may expect me soon.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Full of thought, Mark Sutherland folded up his
letter, and went to the study of Colonel Ashley.</p>

<p class='c005'>The old gentleman received him with a degree of
kindness almost paternal. He arose and took his
hand, and requested him to be seated. Then, after
some delicate hesitation, he said—</p>

<p class='c005'>“I was not, until this morning, made aware of the
very interesting relations which you once sustained
towards a young lady—your cousin—now the wife
of my son. You were once engaged to be married to
Miss Sutherland, I hear?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, sir,” replied the young man, seating himself,
in a calm, unembarrassed manner; while the old gentleman
scrutinized the expression of his countenance,
without finding anything there to displease him.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>“Will you object to informing me of the cause of
the disruption of that engagement?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Certainly not, sir: we differed upon the subject
of slavery. She took sides with her friends, and—we
parted; that is all.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You mean, my honoured young friend, that when
called to do so, you made a stupendous, an unprecedented
sacrifice of fortune, family affection, and love,
for the sake of principle—mistaken principle, perhaps,
yet still principle. Was it not so?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mark Sutherland bowed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My dear young friend, <em>we differ in opinion</em>; but I
highly respect you. I earnestly pray that you may
be set right,” said the old gentleman, warmly, as he
held out his hand to Mark, who grasped it, pressed it,
and let it fall.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mr. Sutherland, in every exigency of your life, I
pray you to consider me as your friend, ready always
to serve you with counsel or assistance of any kind
I have fancied that since the unexpected rencounter of
last evening, you might have something to propose;
or, rather, that you might <em>wish</em> to propose, yet be withheld
by some exquisite sense of honour and delicacy.
I entreat you now to waive all considerations save
those of truth, and speak freely to me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I had something to say to you, Colonel Ashley,
and, under the circumstances, the approach of the
subject was, as you rightly inferred, extremely difficult
to me. I thank you for having opened the way,”
said the young man, <em>totally misapprehending him</em>; then,
after a moment’s hesitation, he went on to say—“You
have doubtless surmised the nature of the communication
I had to make to you. It is, that I love your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>niece, Miss Vivian; I have told her as much within
a few hours past, and have her permission to entreat
your sanction of our engagement.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Colonel Ashley sprang from his chair, shoving it
behind him, and stood gazing with astonishment upon
the young man—with simple astonishment, unmixed
with regret or resentment. At last—</p>

<p class='c005'>“How long has this gone on, sir, without my
knowledge?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I fancied it was <em>not</em> without your knowledge, sir.
Our association has been very open. I fancied, from
your own words, that you expected the communication
I have just made,” said Mark, with a surprise
almost equal to his own.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, sir, no! my words referred to a totally different
matter, which I shall explain presently,” replied
the old gentleman, resuming his seat, with a somewhat
changed manner. “So you have addressed Miss
Vivian?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mark bowed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And won her consent to be yours?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Another bow of assent.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Humph! well—so I have been truly warned, after
all! Pray, Mr. Sutherland, have you ever tried to
instil into the minds of my sons, your pupils, any of
your own opinions in respect to slavery?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have never named the subject to them, sir. I
have endeavoured to cultivate in them principles
of truth, justice, and mercy, and left the application
of those principles to that subject to time and circumstances.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Humph! Have you ever convened my coloured
people, and preached insurrection to them?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>“Sir!” exclaimed Mark, with the indignant blood
purpling his forehead.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nay, nay! don’t look so. God knows, if you had
done so, I should have sought no vengeance, young
man.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Colonel Ashley, I am neither mad nor unprincipled,
however I may have been misrepresented to
you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I believe it, Mark! I quite believe it. I will not
examine you upon the <em>fourth charge</em>! Heaven knows
what demonstrations of indignation would meet my
question, should I ask you if, poet-wise, you had endeavoured
to awaken in Mrs. Ashley’s memory any
sentimental reminiscences of the past!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mark smiled.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yet nevertheless, my dear young friend, it was upon
<em>that subject</em> that I wished to speak to you. Mr. and
Mrs. Ashley will make this house their permanent home.
My son’s wife will be the mistress of the establishment,
of course. Will it be pleasant for you to meet them
in daily, hourly intercourse? I have seen it written,
that ‘friendship sometimes turns to love, but love to
friendship never.’ A brimstone sentiment, I admit.
Still, I can imagine cases and characters to which it is
applicable. For instance, I do not think it possible
for you and your cousin ever to be friends.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mark was silent.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You do not speak. Do you perchance imagine
that you two could live comfortably under the same
roof?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Colonel Ashley, I know we could not.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That will do; we understand each other. And I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>leave all the rest to yourself. I will speak with you
again to-morrow. In the meantime, do me the favour
to let Miss Vivian know that I wish to see her.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Come here, Rosalie; I want to have a very serious
talk with you, my child,” said Colonel Ashley, rising
to meet his niece, as she entered, and leading her to
a seat. “Now, my dear, I am very sorry for something
that I have just heard. Nay, now, be calm, my
dear—I am not going to scold. If I indulge in any
sort of reproach, it must be in self-reproach for my
own reprehensible carelessness. And so, my child,
you are engaged to be married!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Rosalie’s face crimsoned, and her eyes fell to the
ground.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And what good, Rosalie, do you think will ever
come of this imprudent step?”</p>

<p class='c005'>The blush deepened on her cheek, but she did not
reply.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And what am I to think of this penniless young
man, who uses his position in my family to wile the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>affections of my niece—an heiress? Would it not be
a fair and rational conclusion to set him down as an
unprincipled fortune-hunter?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Rosalie started. Her eyes flashed, her lips quivered.
She exclaimed—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Uncle, you do not believe that—you do not!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Would it not be fair to believe it?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Uncle, you are a noble-hearted being—you always
recognise true nobility in others. Uncle, be just to Mr.
Sutherland—nay, be just to yourself—unsay your
words.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why, Rosalie, ninety-nine out of a hundred would
call your lover a fortune-hunter.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, sir, they could not—they could not! knowing
that Mr. Sutherland voluntarily renounced a large fortune
for an idea of duty.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“At any rate, Rosalie, here are the naked facts:
Mark Sutherland, being quite penniless, and well
knowing that he has no way on earth of supporting
a wife, makes the best use of his opportunities to woo
and win an heiress!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Rosalie dropped her face into her hands; her bosom
heaved convulsively, as with some inward struggle,
for an instant, and then lifting a countenance blushing
and tearful, yet gently resolute, she said, in a faltering
voice:</p>

<p class='c005'>“I must make a confession, even if it cover me with
humiliation. I must clear Mr. Sutherland, and take
the blame where it truly belongs—upon my own head.
Uncle, it was <em>my fault</em>—<em>my own</em>—<em>mine solely</em>.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She paused, for her girl’s nature would not bear the
look the old man fixed upon her. She averted her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>face, and with deeply flushed cheek and low, tremulous
voice, resumed:</p>

<p class='c005'>“I loved him, uncle. It was impossible, adoring
moral heroism as I did, <em>not</em> to love him. God and
angels know it, and you must know it, too”——</p>

<p class='c005'>Again she paused for an answer, but Colonel Ashley
did not reply, and she asked—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Uncle! you exonerate Mr. Sutherland now, do you
not?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes!” exclaimed Colonel Ashley, speaking as if
waking up out of a reverie. “I exonerated him at
first; I only wanted to see, Rosalie, whether you would
have the honour and generosity to admit what you
have. Good heaven! It seems to me fully one half
the love originates with the girls, although they have
too much tact to let us know it! Now, there was
your aunt: I was two years courting her. In truth, I
thought I had a terrible time to win her heart; but
listen, now. Some time after we had been married,
she told me how many months she had been ‘setting
her cap’ at me before I ever thought of her; and yet
you see after she had once gained her point, and
brought me to her feet, she kept me on the tenterhooks
of suspense for two years!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“May I go now? Are you done with me, uncle?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, my dear, I have not begun with you yet! I
must give you a lecture! Don’t you know it was a
very unmaidenly thing of you to ‘set your cap’ at
Mr. Sutherland?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Uncle, Mr. Sutherland evidently does not pronounce
such a judgment, and therefore it is not so.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, poor fellow! because he doesn’t know you <em>did</em>
it. <em>He’s</em> under the illusion that he did all the lovemaking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>himself. That’s natural. But now, then,
Rosalie, how do you expect to get along in this world
if you and Mark are married? You may know that
<em>he</em> has no way of supporting you, and your guardian
would see you both in the bottomless pit before <em>he’d</em>
advance a cent of your fortune. Come, stop blushing
and trembling, and answer me, my dear. I like people
to be practical. What do you expect to do?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I do not know, uncle; I wish to leave it all to Mr.
Sutherland. I have so much confidence in his judgment
and in his regard for me, that I feel perfectly
sure he will never draw me into any evil or suffering.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Always faith in Mark! Suppose he should be
going away in a few days, and suppose he should
wish to marry and take you with him?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“In that case, I should wish to go, dear uncle.
Have you done with me now, sir?” asked Rosalie,
really distressed by the length and closeness of the
examination to which she had been subjected.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, you may go!” answered the old gentleman,
rising, and holding the door open for her to pass.
And Rosalie left the study.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the lower hall she saw Mark Sutherland. He
came to meet her, drew her arm within his own, and
then they both walked into the garden.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, dear Rosalie, do you know that I shall
probably leave here in the course of a week?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My uncle has just hinted it to me. Where do you
go?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Back to the village of S——, to take possession of
an established office about to be vacated by my friend
Lauderdale, who is coming on here, upon an errand
of which you are already apprised, my dear Rosalie.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>“Yes, I know mamma and Mr. Lauderdale will be
united next month.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, dear Rosalie?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am going away in a week—must we then part?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not unless you wish to go and leave me behind,
Mark.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Wish to leave you behind! In leaving you I
should turn my back upon my guiding star, my inspiration,
my life!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then I accompany you, Mark.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Your friends, Rose, will they not raise serious
opposition?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No! I have neither father nor mother, and there
are no other friends who have any wish to rule me, or
any interest in doing so. My young step-mother is
going to break the conventional tie between herself
and me by marrying a second time; and with her <em>own</em>
heart under the gentle influence of happiness, she will
not be disposed to wring mine. As for my uncle, his
son has brought a wife home now, who will be the
mistress of his house, and he no longer requires my
presence in that capacity. Indeed, I might even be
considered in the way. And neither am I disposed to
take a second place in a household of which I have
hitherto been at the head. And that reminds me that
I am at the head of it <em>still</em>, and that the duties of
the position press upon me every hour—even now,”
said Rosalie, moving to go.</p>

<p class='c005'>He caught her hand to detain her.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Stay—do not leave me just yet. And so, my
dearest Rosalie, when I go forth you will accompany
me?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>“I have said that if you wish it—yes, I will accompany
you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“God bless you, dearest Rose!” burst from his lips
with impassioned fervour. “But, my dear girl—my
fairy, fragile girl—do you know what women in the
far West have to encounter? hardships from which
the most robust shrink; hardships from which the
strong and beautiful India shrank; and will my pale,
frail Rosalie dare them? and can she bear them?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“India, with her glorious physique, is still a delicate
daughter of the sun; she is like a gorgeous, brilliant
exotic, that can bloom only in a luxurious conservatory;
while I, with my wan face and fragile form, am
yet a child of the wind—a wood-anemone, that only
withered in a Southern hothouse—that will flourish
and thrive in the wilderness.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Heaven grant it may be as you say, dear Rosalie!
It is impossible for me to give you up, to leave you;
yet when I think of all you may have to suffer in
being my companion, my heart is filled with anxiety
and trouble. What did you say, dearest? Your
sweetest words hide under low tones, just as the
sweetest violets lurk under thick shade. What were
you murmuring?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Only that I should not suffer half as much in
meeting anything <em>with you</em>, as I should—as I should”—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, dearest?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“<em>In being left behind</em>,” said Rosalie, dropping her
head upon his shoulder, as he caught her to his heart,
and exclaimed, in a sudden burst of emotion—</p>

<p class='c005'>“You shall <em>not</em> be left behind, my darling! my
darling! By all my hopes of earth and heaven, I will
never, never part from you!”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>For a moment her head had rested on his breast in
peace, and then she began to grow restless and twisted
herself out of his embrace.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Where now?” he asked, rather impatiently.</p>

<p class='c005'>She looked at him with a comic expression of
countenance, and said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is a mortifying necessity to confess, but the
truth is, the <em>ham</em> has to be taken out of soak and put
on to boil for dinner, and I have got to see it done;
also there are gooseberry tarts and lemon custard to
be prepared for the dessert, and I have got to go and
do it. I wonder if uncle and cousin St. Gerald, who
both love their palates, (low be it spoken,) will ever
get anything fit to eat when the gorgeous Mrs. India
takes my place!” and so, laughing and escaping,
she ran off.</p>

<p class='c004'>The world-honoured and time-honoured bard whose
lines are quoted above habitually looked beneath the
mere plausible surface of possibility, and from the
deep insight thereby gained, often put forth oracles at
opposition to the usual routine of thought and expectation,
yet which the eternal experiences of life continue
to endorse as truths.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>Were I writing a merely fictitious narrative, it
would be in order now (after the custom-sanctioned
manner of story-tellers) to describe the cruel opposition
the lovers met from tyrannical parents, guardians,
&#38;c. But I am writing a true story—in this
particular at least, “stranger than fiction”—and so
have no such events to relate.</p>

<p class='c005'>It happened as Rosalie had predicted—she met no
serious opposition to the current of her affections.
And if we look into the causes of that leniency on the
part of her guardians, we shall not find their non-resistance
so unaccountable, after all.</p>

<p class='c005'>Left without father or mother—without near relatives
or natural protectors, except a youthful step-dame,
now too entirely absorbed in the contemplation
of her own marriage, and an old uncle, to whom until
two years past she had been a perfect stranger, Miss
Vivian was thus not the first object of interest to any
one around her.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is true, that when Rosalie made known her purpose
to Mrs. Vivian, the lady opposed the contemplated
marriage with entreaties and tears; but finding that
entreaties and tears only distressed the maiden without
shaking her resolution, the young step-mother felt
neither the right nor the inclination to attempt the
arbitrary control of Miss Vivian’s destiny. In yielding
her final consent, the sweet-lipped lady said, amid
falling tears—“Oh! were he well established, Rosalie,
there is no one in the world to whom I would resign
you with so much pleasure and comfort, as to him
whom you have chosen. And well I know, and
deeply I feel, that even now, from this low point of
life—with you by his side—with you for an incentive—with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>his high moral principles and intellectual
faculties, and in this favoured country, he <em>must</em> rise,
he <em>must</em> accomplish a brilliant destiny. But O, Rosalie,
my child, in the meanwhile, I dread for you those
toilsome, terrible first steps on the road to success! O
Rosalie, pause! How much wiser to wait until he has
conquered success!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And share his triumphs when I would not share
his toils? No! no! no!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It would be so much safer, Rosalie!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And so much more <em>prudent</em> to allow him, in those
moments of depression and despondency that must
come, to think that it is only the <em>successful</em> statesman
or jurist whose fortunes I would share, not those of
the toiling aspirant! To turn a second India on his
hands, and so forever and forever break down his
faith in womanhood, in disinterestedness, and in truth!
No! no! no! and a thousand times no! I have the
blessed privilege of healing the heart that India
wounded, of lifting up the brow that she bowed down,
of strengthening and sustaining the faith that she
weakened.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“If you should be a burden to him?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I will <em>never</em> be a burden to him! Providence will
never so fail me. Mine is no sudden girlish fancy. It
is a deep, earnest affection, arising from the profoundest
sentiments of esteem and honour that ever woman felt
for man—and the Father who inspired it will bless it.
<span class='sc'>He</span> who in his benignant love said, ‘It is not good for
man to be alone,’ will strengthen me to be a true
help-meet for my husband.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“O Rosalie! be <em>practical</em>, child!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Be faithful first, and practical afterwards.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>“Rosalie, you don’t know what you brave! Fancy
yourself and Mark now married, and housekeeping
(forsooth!) in some wretched log cabin or some lath-and-plaster
shell of a shanty, in some new Western
village. Fancy yourselves both down with that curse
of new settlements, the ague, and each unable to help
the other, and no one to give you a cup of tea, and
perhaps with no tea in the house.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That is a plain statement of a very dismal contingency,
dear mamma. Yet I have no doubt that we
should shiver and shake safely through it, as others
have done. Yet it is not fair or wise to contemplate
the worst possibility only. The Western pioneers are
not always laid up <em>with</em> the ague and <em>without</em> tea!” said
Rosalie, with a sparkle of fun in her eyes.</p>

<p class='c005'>But in a moment after, the young girl’s face grew
serious, and she said, in a tremulous voice, “And
besides, dear mamma, the very bugbears that you
have evoked to frighten me from my journey only
draw me on to go. Oh, do you think, mamma, that
I could bear to stay here in safety, ease, and luxury,
and know that he was far away, exposed to all the
dangers, hardships, and privations of a pioneer life?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nonsense! Danger is the natural element of man!
to seek it is the nature of the creature!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, mamma; but illness, fever, burning thirst,
solitude, and helplessness, is <em>not</em>. And, if I thought that
Mark were suffering all these things in some wretched
Western cabin, and I not near to bathe his head and
give him a cup of cold water, and to nurse and comfort
and soothe him, but separated from him by thousands
of miles of mountains and plains, I tell you,
mamma, it would nearly break my heart! It is no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>use! I <em>must</em> go with him, to meet whatever of good or
ill Fate has in store. It can have nothing else so evil
as a separation! Oh! I feel as if the worst calamity
that could possibly befall me, would be a separation
from him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Foolish girl! You love that broad-shouldered,
robust man, as tenderly as a mother loves her babe!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I love him with a tenderness and sympathy that
makes me tremblingly alive to his least sorrow or
lightest pain; and yet mark you, mamma, with an
esteem, with a depth of respect, with an honour that
makes me aspire to his approbation as my highest
good under Heaven!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“O Rosalie, I will not farther oppose you! Yet, if
you only had strength to endure the hardships of a
Western life, I should feel less anxiety.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Do not fear. I shall be able to endure, because
‘my good will is to it;’ and energetic, because I shall
have a good motive; and healthy, because I shall be
happy—because my heart will be right and at rest;
for I say it again, because it is a great deep truth—‘<em>Out
of the heart are the issues of life!</em>’ Yes, out of the
heart are the issues of will, purpose, hope, health,
strength, enterprise, achievement, <span class='fss'>SUCCESS</span>! Out of
the heart are the issues of all the good that can come
back to us in time or eternity! on earth or in
Heaven!”</p>

<p class='c004'>With Miss Vivian’s uncle the difficulty was even
less in obtaining his consent to the marriage with
Mark Sutherland; and for the following reasons:—Colonel
Ashley worshipped his proud, talented son,
St. Gerald; and in his estimation no interests could
compete for an instant with St. Gerald’s interests.
Colonel Ashley liked Rosalie well enough, and wished
her well enough, and he was resolved to do all he
could to insure her future happiness; yet if a slight
risk of her welfare would insure the domestic peace
and content of St. Gerald, Colonel Ashley was not
one to hesitate between the conflicting interests of his
niece and son. And that the marriage and departure
of Mark Sutherland and Rosalie would tend greatly
to tranquillise the life of the already disturbed husband,
he could not <em>now</em> doubt.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was dreadful to notice all the fatal effects of
India’s want of faith—it was awful to anticipate the
final result. The once haughty and self-possessed
woman was growing spiritless and nervous, subject to
extremes of excitement and depression, moody, irritable,
and flighty to the last degree. Her glorious
beauty was <em>withering</em>, <em>wilting</em>, as you have seen some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>richly-blooming flower wither suddenly without apparent
cause—wither as if scorched by the burning
breath of the sirocco. And the cause was apparent to
every one around her, not excepting her bitterly-wronged
and most wretched husband—to every one
around her but Rosalie, whose perfect truth and innocence
of heart shielded her from the suspicion of so
much evil. If it was fearful to see the ravages that
misery had made in the glorious beauty of India, it
was not less so to observe its desolating effect upon
the splendid genius of St. Gerald.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was now a stirring time with aspiring young
statesmen. A great national crisis was at hand; and
it behooved all prominent politicians to be up and doing.
St. Gerald, of all statesmen, should have been
the most active, the most energetic. The eyes of his
party were turned in anxiety towards him—the eyes
of old grey heads, exhausted by a long life’s service,
and reposing on their well-earned laurels, and the eyes
of young aspirants, panting to succeed to them, were
all fixed upon St. Gerald, as their hope, their leader,
and their deliverer! A senator already, he is carried
up on the tenth wave of popular favour! Should he
serve them well in this crisis, as he surely <em>can</em> if he
<em>will</em>, for his talent, his eloquence, his influence is
mighty among the nations; should he serve them well
this time, there is no honour, no, not the highest in
the gift of the people, to which he may not reasonably
aspire! St. Gerald should be busy now—riding
from town to town, from county to county, from
State to State—convening the people, organising
meetings, making speeches, drawing up resolutions,
and doing all those multifarious acts by which statesmen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>in the recess of Congress touch the secret springs
of the great political machinery, to keep it in motion,
or haply to stop it altogether. St. Gerald should
be up and doing, for now is the “tide” in his affairs,
which “taken at the flood” may bear him on to fortune—aye,
ultimately to the Presidential chair. St.
Gerald should be active, stirring—for every day is
destiny! But the young statesman is doing absolutely
nothing. He is withering in inaction, because his bride
is withering from his side.</p>

<p class='c005'>Colonel Ashley perceives it all. And can he see
the brilliant fortunes of his proud boy thus wrecked,
if the sacrifice of Rosalie will help to avert the ruin?
No, Rosalie! Only give yourself to Mark Sutherland,
and coax him away to “parts unknown,” to
that “borne whence no traveller returneth,” if possible,
and your uncle will smooth your path—he will
try to persuade Clement Sutherland to forego his wrath
and hate, and yield you up your own fortune—he will
give you his blessing, and as much assistance of every
kind as your independent spirit will permit you to
accept.</p>

<p class='c005'>Colonel Ashley, in fact, gave his full consent and
approbation to the engagement of Mark Sutherland
and Rosalie Vivian. He even joined Mr. Sutherland
in persuading Rosalie to fix an early day for the
solemnization of the marriage.</p>

<p class='c005'>And, having settled that matter to his satisfaction,
he next sought his friend, Clement Sutherland, and,
having informed him of the betrothal, entreated him
to make some provision from the bride’s fortune for
the young couple, or at least to settle an annuity upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span><em>her</em> until she should be of age, and enter upon the
possession of her property.</p>

<p class='c005'>But Clement Sutherland was proof against all arguments
and entreaties. He locked his grim jaws fast,
and would yield not a cent or a kind word. At last
Colonel Ashley left him in indignation and despair.
He did not <em>then</em> know that hate and revenge were not
the only reasons that constrained the guardian of
Mark Sutherland’s young bride to hold a death-grip
upon her purse-strings. No one <em>then</em> suspected that
the money-grasping passion of the man had tempted
him into ruinous speculations and embezzlement of
the orphan’s funds. “Sufficient unto the day is the
evil thereof;” therefore, let them not dream it yet!</p>

<p class='c005'>A week after this betrothal, Mr. Lauderdale arrived,
to fulfil his engagement with the “sparkling” young
widow. He was received with the utmost pleasure by
his old friends and acquaintances, and welcomed with
cordial hospitality by Colonel Ashley.</p>

<p class='c005'>The next week witnessed two bridals. Mr. Lauderdale
and Mrs. Vivian were married at Ashley Hall,
by the pastor of the parish; and at the same time and
place, by the same minister, Mark Sutherland and
Rosalie Vivian were united in that bond that only
death can sever.</p>

<p class='c005'>The next day there were two departures: Mr. and
Mrs. Lauderdale bade an affectionate adieu to their
friends, and set out for their palace home in the South;
and Mark Sutherland, and Rosalie, his wife, departed
for their log cabin in the West.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>“Rosalie, my own blessed wife, you spoke the
truth, or, rather, you applied it fitly—‘out of the
heart are the issues of life!’ I feel and recognize it
now. It is with far different emotions that I tread
this deck, that bears us on to the great West, to those
which oppressed and discouraged my soul two years
ago. Then, dearest, I went forth alone, unloved, unloving;
now your form hangs upon my arm, not an
incumbrance, but a source of strength and joy. But,
O Rosalie, how is it—how <em>will</em> it be with you? Can
you love the wild West as you love your own sunny
South?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘Westward the star of empire wends its way.’
Who can look upon the shores of this great river, and
note the many thriving new villages, without joyfully
perceiving that? The South is a beautiful, a luxuriant
region, where, ‘lapped in Elysium,’ you may dream
your soul away; but the West is a magnificently
vigorous land, whose clarion voice summons you to
action. The South might be illustrated by a beautiful
epicurienne, like India—the West only by a vigorous
young Titan, like”——</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>“Whom?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mark Sutherland!” answered Rosalie, with her
eyes sparkling with delight.</p>

<p class='c005'>They were standing upon the hurricane deck of the
steamer Indian Queen, which was puffing and blowing
its rapid course down the Ohio river. She was leaning
on the arm of her husband; their heads were bare,
the better to enjoy the freshness of the morning air;
her eyes were sparkling, and her cheeks glowing with
animation, and her sunny ringlets, blown back, floated
on the breeze.</p>

<p class='c005'>From their elevated site they commanded a view
of both shores of the river, and turned their eyes
alternately from the north to the south side.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Does my dear Rosalie perceive any very remarkable
difference in the aspect of these opposite shores?”
asked Mark, bending his serious gaze upon her.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes! I notice that one shore is thickly studded
with thriving villages and flourishing fields, while the
other is a comparative wilderness, with here and there
a plantation house, and at long intervals a stunted
town. What can be the reason of this?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Have you not already surmised the reason?”</p>

<p class='c005'>The thoughtful eyes of Rosalie roved slowly over
the scene, and then raised and fixed their earnest gaze
upon her husband’s face, and she said—</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is so. There is only one set of persons in the
civilized world who are more unhappy than the
negroes.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And they are”——</p>

<p class='c005'>“Their masters.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, Rosalie; and it is from among their number
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>that the first great successful reformer of the great
evil must arise!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why do you think so, Mark?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“From <em>fitness</em>: we are unwilling to be taught our
duty by an antagonist who reasons in partial ignorance
of the facts, judges harshly and unjustly, and
speaks not the truth in love so often as falsehood in
hatred; and from <em>analogy</em>: all great successful reformers
that the world has ever known, have arisen—not
from the outside, but from the very midst of the
evil to be reformed. Martin Luther sprang, not from
among the Illuminati, but from the bosom of the
Roman Catholic Church and priesthood. Nay, Christ
himself came not in clouds of glory, clothed with the
majesty of Godhead from Heaven—he arose from the
midst of the people whom he came to redeem. So,
Rosalie, the apostle of liberty must arise in the
South.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She had listened to his words with loving and
reverent attention, and now she fixed her gaze upon
his eyes, and said, with penetrating earnestness—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mark Sutherland—‘<em>Thou art the man!</em>’”</p>

<p class='c005'>His very soul thrilled to her inspiring words and
glance. He walked hastily from her side in agitation,
but, soon returning, said—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nay, Rosalie, nay; this mission is not for me. I
hear no voice from heaven calling me to the work!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“<em>Have you listened?</em> The voice of God speaks not
often in thunder from Heaven. It is a ‘still, small
voice,’ breathed from the depths of your spirit. ‘The
word of God is within you.’”</p>

<p class='c005'>He pressed his hand to his brow, throwing back the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>dark hair that fell in waves around it. He was still
agitated, excited.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You trouble my soul even as the descending
angel troubled the pool of Bethesda, Rosalie!” he
said.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Only to arouse its powers,” she answered, carrying
out the simile. While speaking, she anxiously
sought his eyes, which at last met hers in a loving
gaze, and then she continued,—“You have consecrated
your mission as only such a mission can be consecrated,
by a great sacrifice at its commencement—<em>can you
pause</em> now?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Rosalie! Rosalie! why had I not known you better
before? Why could I not have loved you only
from the first? Why have the last two or three
years of my life been lonely and wasted?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I had to grow up for you. I had to be left to
mature in solitude and silence. I was a child three
years ago.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And you are a child still, young priestess of liberty!
A child still in all things but the inspired wisdom of
your heart!”</p>

<p class='c005'>We have no time nor space to follow the course
of this young pair, step by step, or to relate the many
conversations they held together, in which hand upheld
hand, heart strengthened heart, spirit inspired
spirit, until the two grew into one—with one heart,
soul, and spirit—one interest, purpose, and object.</p>

<p class='c005'>The boat wended on her way, reached the mouth
of the Ohio river, and turned up the Mississippi; and
in five days more landed at the new village of S——,
in the Northwest Territory. It was very early in the
morning; the sun had not yet risen, and the fog still
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>lay, white and heavy, upon the wilderness shores—for
here the wilderness, exuberant and luxuriant in vegetation,
lay all around—and the new village of S——
was at the very outskirts of pioneer civilization. It
was situated on the right or east bank of the Upper
Mississippi, and the dwellings were scattered up and
down the high bluff so oddly, that a passenger, looking
upon the hamlet, said it seemed as if a giant had
gathered a handful of houses and flung them at the
bluff, and that they had settled at random where they
had fallen.</p>

<p class='c005'>Our young couple were the only passengers for
S——, and they followed their baggage into the skiff,
and were landed just as the sun arose, gilding the
windows of the village, and lighting up into splendour
all the glorious scene.</p>

<p class='c005'>“See, Mark! It is a happy omen,” said Rosalie
smiling.</p>

<p class='c005'>He pressed her hand, and turned upon her a look
of unspeakable love, as he handed her to the shore.</p>

<p class='c005'>There was a porter even in that rude, remote place.
He took charge of the baggage, and led the way to
the hotel on the top of the bluff.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was a large, unfinished, two-story frame house,
rudely built of rough pine boards, unpainted without,
and unplastered within. Our young couple followed
their guide, the porter, who was also the landlord,
into the large bare parlour, which was also the kitchen
of the inn. This room was scantily furnished, with a
few rough chairs, a table neatly enough set out for
breakfast, and a glowing cooking-stove, in full blast,
at which stood the cook, who was also the landlady,
getting breakfast.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>The rudeness of the whole scene disturbed Mark,
for Rosalie’s sake. She felt that it did. She looked
at him with a gladdening smile, exclaiming—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh! I like it, Mark. I like it so much. Everything
is so new and strange, and so free and easy.
And so large and grand,” she added, going to one of
the windows, and looking out, with delighted eyes,
upon the magnificent virgin country. “The air is
fine here, Mark. There is a springiness and life in it
I never felt before, even on the mountains. And see,
the fog is all dispersed already.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes—it’s allowed to be healthy in these parts; no
ague here,” said the landlady.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And so near the river—that is strange,” said
Mark.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, you see the winds blow mostly from the
shore; and the fog—when there <em>is</em> a fog—settles on
the other side of the river. And then, many folks
allow that this, being a high, lime-stone country, is
naterally healthy.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Have you many boarders now?” inquired Rosalie,
kindly interesting herself in the fortunes of her
hostess.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Only bachelors, for constant. Sometimes, when a
boat-load of people arrive, we have a house full, till
they gets settled or goes somers else,” replied the landlady,
setting the coffee-pot on the table, and ordering
her lord and master to go to the door and blow the
horn. She then invited her guests to sit down to
breakfast, and had just begun to help them, when her
other boarders, the bachelors—half-a-dozen robust,
rudely-clothed, but earnest, intelligent-looking men—entered,
and gathered around the table. The breakfast
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>was plain, but substantial, well-cooked, and abundant.
And our young pair, as well as the bachelors,
did justice to the fare.</p>

<p class='c005'>After breakfast “the bachelors” left the table and
the house, and went about their various businesses—some
to their stores, some to their workshops. The
landlady bustled about to wash up and clear away
her breakfast service; and Mark Sutherland followed
his young wife to the window, and said—</p>

<p class='c005'>“And now, dear Rosalie, I must leave you here, <em>at
least</em> till noon.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You must?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes; there is much to be done, that must be done
immediately. Lauderdale’s deserted law office must
be opened and aired, and my sign—or <em>shingle</em>, as the
folks here call it—tacked up, and the place generally
prepared for the transaction of any business that may
turn up. Then I have to write and send off an advertisement
to the nearest newspaper—which, by the
way, is published in a town thirty miles distant. And
lastly, dear Rose, I have to look up a cabin, or part
of a frame house, where ‘two mortal mice,’ like you
and I, may go to housekeeping. Whether all this
can be accomplished in a forenoon, or not, I do not
know; but, at all events, I shall try to be back again
at twelve. Good bye.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And, pressing her hand, he left her.</p>

<p class='c005'>Rosalie seated herself by the window, and looked
out upon the new country. From the river, and from
the grove that crowned the bluff on which the village
was situated, the country stretched eastward, out and
out—a high, level, and limitless prairie, its flat and
green monotony broken, at wide intervals, by groves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>similar to this which surrounded S——, and relieved
by countless millions of wild flowers, whose rich, gorgeous,
and brilliant hues surpassed anything the observer
had ever seen before.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What is that splendid scarlet flower that grows so
tall, and is as abundant on the prairie as clover in our
own fields?” inquired Rosalie.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I reckon you are talking about the prairie pink;
but I haven’t much time, myself, to take notice of
flowers—’specially wild weeds,” replied the landlady,
rattling the dishes and tea-cups, and bustling about
between the cooking-stove, the table, and the cupboard.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Are you not a Marylander?” asked Rosalie.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes,” said the woman. “How did you know?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“By your speech.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Just at this moment the cry of a child commenced
in an adjoining room, and continued during the whole
of the hostess’s morning work. She set aside the
table, and began to sweep the room, raising a great
dust from the dried and pulverized mud left by the
bachelors’ shoes. Rosalie thoughtlessly threw her
pocket-handkerchief over her head, to protect her
hair from the dust—thoughtlessly, for else she might
have guessed it would displease the touchy pride of
the hard-working pioneer woman.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You don’t like the dust—maybe you never saw a
broom?” she asked, looking somewhat contemptuously
at the young lady’s delicate person.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh! yes, I have,” said Rosalie, gently, “and <em>used</em>
a broom, too; but I always sprinkle the floor, and tie
a handkerchief over my head before sweeping.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And what do you take all that trouble for?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>“Because I dislike the dust to settle on my hair.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ha! ha! ha! You’ll get out of that, if you <em>settle</em>
in these parts,” laughed the woman—not ill-naturedly
this time—resuming her broom, and continuing her
sweeping to its completion. Then she fired up the
cooking-stove afresh; and while it was drawing, and
roaring, and heating the room to suffocation in this
sultry summer weather, she wiped down the chairs
with her apron, and finally went into the next chamber
and brought out her baby which was still squalling at
the top of his voice. Giving him a piece of bread, she
sat him in the cradle and went about her work, notwithstanding
that the child threw away the bread, and
was screaming louder than ever. Rosalie got up and
lifted the babe, and took him to the window, where
she sat down with him, and soon soothed his temper.
The over-worked mother looked pleased, but said,
deprecatingly—</p>

<p class='c005'>“You needn’t adone that; ’tain’t a bit o’ use; it’ll
only spile him. You’ll find ’twon’t do. And if ever
you have a house of your own, and a baby of your
own, and no one to tend to nyther but yourself—<em>mark
my words</em>—just exactly when the loaf of bread is
burning up in the oven, and the tea-kettle is boiling
over, and the fat is catching afire in the frying-pan,
that very time the baby’s going to take to open its
throat and squall you deaf. Let it squall! You
ain’t got twenty pair o’ hands—you can’t tend to
everything at once. You’ll find it so, too—mark my
words—I never knew it to fail!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That is a very discouraging picture, indeed,” said
Rosalie; “nevertheless, I should try to foresee and
prevent such a combination of perplexities.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>“Oh! <em>would</em> you? You may thank goodness if, on
top of all that, your man aint down with a spell of
sickness, and the cow lost in the woods, and the well
dry!” said the hostess, going to the door, and rapping,
and calling out—</p>

<p class='c005'>“John! <em>You</em> John!”</p>

<p class='c005'>The landlord, <em>her</em> “man,” obeyed the summons,
entering from the bar-room. She met him with a
sharp rebuke, for not bringing water enough, not
splitting wood enough, not bringing the vegetables for
dinner—“An’ <em>it</em> drawin’ on to ’leven o’clock—and he
knew the bachelors would be home to dinner at
twelve.” And pushing the empty pail into his hand,
she bade him make haste to the well, and be back in
no time with the water, and so she hustled him out of
the house. And soon the process of dinner-cooking
was commenced; and in addition to the melting heat
of the stove, the various mingled steams of boiling,
stewing, and frying arose, and filled the summer air
with thick, greasy vapour.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Surely cooking-stoves were first invented by the
demon,” Rosalie could not help thinking, while she
resolved, whenever she had to cook, it should be in an
open fire-place, where the stifling vapours could ascend
the chimney.</p>

<p class='c005'>When dinner was ready, the sound of the horn
summoned the same company, who entered first an
adjoining shed, where they all washed their faces and
hands, using the same tin basin and the same crash
towel, and then—coarse, ruddy, healthful, and hungry—they
came in, and gathered around the table. A few
minutes after they had sat down, Mark Sutherland
returned from his morning’s ramble, and took his
seat among them.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>“How have you prospered in your enterprise to-day,
Mark?” asked Rosalie, as they left the table.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have got through all I wished to do to my perfect
satisfaction, except one thing.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And that?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have not been able to rent a house, or a part of
a house, either for love or money! And so, dear
Rosalie, I shall have to leave you again this afternoon,
in order to renew my search. And I am afraid
you find the time hang very heavily.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not at all, I assure you, Mark. I have been
occupied and interested. Everything is so different
here from what I have ever been accustomed to.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, very different, indeed!” said Mark Sutherland,
with a sigh.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now, I didn’t mean that,” said Rosalie, smiling.
“I meant that everything is so new and strange that
I am entertained and amused every moment.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Entertain and amuse yourself, then, as well as
you can, until I come back in the evening; then, my
love,” whispered Mark, stealthily pressing her hand
to his heart, as he left her.</p>

<p class='c005'>The landlady rattled and clattered the dishes, and
bustled about between table, cupboard, and cooking-stove,
until she had cleared away the dinner-service.
And then she proceeded to wash off the stove, raising
a more offensive vapour than before. Then she swept
the floor again; then she got a tub of water and a mop,
and washed it all over. And then, after wiping and
putting away the tub, and pan, and mop, and doing
numberless other “last jobs,” she finally cleansed her
own face and hands, put on a clean apron, and sat
down to nurse her baby, and talk to Rosalie. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>by this time the afternoon was so far spent, that the
poor woman had not rested half an hour before it was
time to get up, fire up the cooking-stove once more,
and prepare supper for her family and her boarders,
who would be back, she said, at six.</p>

<p class='c005'>Rosalie was sympathetically fatigued, only to witness
her labours, and she could not refrain from saying,
as she once more took charge of the fretful, teething
child—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Indeed, you have a great deal to do. I do not
know how you have strength to go through so much.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ah! you will know after a bit; wait a little.
Lord, child, this is nothing at all! wait till wash-day,”
said the hostess, putting a great tray of flour on the
table, and preparing to make bread.</p>

<p class='c005'>And once more the process of cooking went on,
with the same accompaniments of melting heat, stifling
vapour, &#38;c. And again the horn sounded, and
the company gathered; but this time Mark Sutherland
did not appear during the whole course of the
meal—no, nor after it was over.</p>

<p class='c005'>The table was cleared away, the room once more
put in order, the candles lighted for the evening, and
the men gathered in the kitchen, with their pipes, but
still Mark did not come.</p>

<p class='c005'>The landlady was rocking her baby to sleep, and
entering at intervals into the conversation. At last
she arose, and put her child to bed, and asked Rosalie
if she should not like to be shown to her sleeping-room.</p>

<p class='c005'>Rosalie replied in the affirmative; and the hostess
lighted a candle and conducted her through the middle
passage, and up the stairs, and opened a door to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>the right of the landing, leading into a large room,
unplastered, and nearly unfurnished. The room was
divided in the middle by a temporary partition of
hanging blankets. In the first division there were
two double beds, covered with coarse patch-work
quilts. The hostess passed between these, and, putting
aside the blankets, led her guest to the interior division,
which was smaller, and contained only one bed,
covered like the others.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You are to sleep here. Is there anything you
want?” she asked, setting down the candle on a chest
that served as toilet-table and washstand.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes; water and towels, if you please,” replied
Rosalie.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll get them for you in a minute. When do you
look for <em>him</em> in?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mr. Sutherland?—every moment!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Umph! humph! Now tell me the truth—I sha’n’t
blame you—it’s none o’ my business you know, but—<em>ain’t</em>
you and that young man a runaway match?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why, no, certainly not,” said Rosalie, reddening
and laughing. “We were married in my uncle’s
house, and left it with his blessing and good wishes.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That’s right; you must excuse my asking, but you
somehow looked so young and delicate for such a life
as you’re come to, that I couldn’t help thinking that
it must o’ been a <em>love-match</em>.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Rosalie did not say that she hoped it <em>was</em> a love-match,
and the landlady departed on her errand.</p>

<p class='c005'>When she entered, bringing a tin basin and a crash
towel, she put them down upon the chest, and said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“I forgot to tell you that there are four bachelors
sleep in the fore part of the room.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>Rosalie looked up, surprised and shocked. This
feature of western life was quite new to her, and she
was totally unprepared for it.</p>

<p class='c005'>The hostess saw her expression, and hastened to say—“Oh!
they’re very nice, steady young men; they
won’t make a noise, and keep you awake.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But have you no private room unoccupied? Your
house seems large; I should think there were at least
four chambers on this floor?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Lor’ bless you, child, so there are; but the floors
ain’t laid to none o’ them except this one, which is the
reason I have to put so many in it. Bless you, you
mus’n’t mind such things out here—nobody does—’tain’t
like where you come from, you know. And
now, child, if there’s nothing else I can do for you, I
hope you’ll excuse me, for indeed I am so tired I am
almost ready to drop.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Certainly; indeed, I am sorry to have given you so
much trouble. Good night!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Good night!” said the hostess, taking up her candle,
and disappearing through the opening folds of the
blanket.</p>

<p class='c005'>Rosalie did not wish to sleep. The not unpleasant
restlessness, induced by a new and strange position,
drove sleep for a time from her eyes. She drew the
chest to the only window in her part of the room, and
sat down, and opened it, and looked out upon the dark
green prairie, that seemed to roll out like the ocean to
meet the eastern horizon, where the harvest moon was
just rising. The full moon! It was the only familiar
object that met her eyes in all the strange, wild, lonely,
beautiful scene—the only old acquaintance—the only
thing she had known at home! Tears—but not of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>sadness—rushed to her eyes. And then she thought
of the vicissitudes of the last two years, and especially
of the last two months; of her life of almost oriental
luxury in the valley of the Pearl; of her home in the
mountains of Virginia, where she was surrounded by
all the advantages of wealth, taste, elegance, and comfort—where
the eyes of affection watched her motions
all day long, and many servants waited on her lightest
bidding; and then of the roughness and ruggedness
of her present lot. But not in repining, and not in
regret did she compare these various phases of her
life. She was happy if ever young wife was so. She
looked upon the prairie, bathed in the silvery splendour
of moonlight, with its mystic boundaries lost under
the horizon, and its vastness and vagueness cast a
glamour over her imagination, and charmed her with
the fancy of wandering on and on in quest of its unknown
limits, or as far as the vanishing boundaries
might entice her. In the midst of these eyrie reveries
sleep surprised her, and her fair head sank upon her
folded hands on the window-sill.</p>

<p class='c005'>She was awakened by a gentle clasp around her
waist and a gentle voice in her ear, saying—</p>

<p class='c005'>“My Rosalie—asleep at the window with the night
dews falling on your head?”</p>

<p class='c005'>She started, blushed, smiled, and exclaimed, “O,
Mark, is it you? I am so glad that you have
come!”</p>

<p class='c005'>He let down the window, and placed his hand upon
her head to see if it was damp, and asked—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why did you not go to rest, Rosalie?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why, at first I was not sleepy; and I heard that
there were strangers in the next room—or, rather, on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>the other side of the blankets—and it seemed so odd.
I could not get used to the thought in a minute,
Mark.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He answered with a laugh and said, as he looked
around—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, it is rather a rude place, with rather primitive
accommodations, for the first and best hotel in the
great city of Shelton. But, never mind; wait a bit.
In a year or two you shall see this house well and
completely finished, within and without, and the rooms
all properly and comfortably fitted up and furnished,
and the establishment provided with suitable waiters
and chamber-maids; and in half-a-dozen years the host
will probably have made his fortune.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, Mark, and what success have you had this
afternoon?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The best success. I have found a house, which I
think will suit us exactly. Come to the window for
a moment again. Do you see, immediately under the
moon, that distant grove, that looks as if it were just
against the horizon? You see the trees stand up
straight and dark against the sky?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, I see it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That is Wolf’s Grove. It is not more than three
miles from here. I can easily walk the distance twice
a day. There is one building on the spot—a large
log cabin, that was put up for a meeting-house, but
has fallen into disuse since the rise of this village.
The cabin is in good repair, and I have already engaged
it. So, dear wife, we have only to wait for the
arrival of our little furniture, to go to housekeeping.
And to-morrow we will go over to Wolf’s Grove, and
review the premises.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Judge! your plunder’s come—landed from the
‘Sachem’ this morning!” were the words with which
the landlord greeted Mark Sutherland, as the latter,
with Rosalie, descended to breakfast.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Judge!” echoed Rosalie, looking inquiringly from
one to the other.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mark Sutherland laughed, and pinched her arm;
and when their host had moved off in another direction,
said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nonsense, Rose. Yes, it was <em>I</em> whom he addressed
as Judge—of course it was. Every one gets an honorary
title of distinction here. I don’t know what it is
given for; certainly not to confer honour, but rather,
I suppose, for the sake of civil brevity, as it is easier
to say ‘Judge’ than ‘Mr. Thompson.’ Now, if I had
ever belonged to any military company—if only as
private in militia, they’d dub me here ‘Cap’n,’ if not
‘Major,’ or ‘Gen’l:’ and if I were county constable,
instead of law student, they must still call me
‘Judge.’”</p>

<p class='c005'>And just then, as if in illustration of Mr. Sutherland’s
words, several men entered, eagerly inquiring
for “the Colonel,” meaning the landlord. And when
the host came forward to know their will, several
speaking equally together, exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>“Colonel, we want your guns, and your dogs, and
your company, this morning, to hunt a pack of wolves
that chased Jones’s boy almost into the village!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“A pack of wolves!” exclaimed the boarders,
gathering around.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Jones’s boy!” ejaculated the landlord, in amazement.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Riding from McPherson’s mill;”</p>

<p class='c005'>“So close, they caught at the boy’s boots;”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Foremost one hung upon the horse’s flanks;”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Wounded;”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nothing but the animal’s speed saved him;”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Wet with sweat;”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Miraculous ’scape;”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Jones’s boy,” &#38;c., were the broken sentences with
which the tale was told by the several informants, all
speaking at once.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, friends, long as there’s no damage done, I
don’t see any use in being so excited. As to my
guns and dogs, you can have them in welcome; but
as to my company, I have promised the Judge here
to drive him and his wife over to see their house.
And I expect they will want me to haul the plunder
over too—won’t you, Judge?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mark Sutherland bowed.</p>

<p class='c005'>After a little discussion, they urged “the Judge”
to join their hunt, and Rosalie privately squeezed
Mark’s arm in disapproval. Mark declined; and, after
a little more altercation, the visitors at length departed,
with three or four of the bachelor boarders, who
quaffed each a “hasty” cup of coffee and followed.</p>

<p class='c005'>When this little disturbance was over—</p>

<p class='c005'>“I did not know,” said Mr. Sutherland, “that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>wild denizens of the forest ever ventured so near the
settlements.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No more they don’t,” replied the host; “only this
go, I s’pose, the Injuns have been hunting of ’em and
druv ’em close on to the village. We’ll git shut of ’em
agin after a bit.”</p>

<p class='c005'>When breakfast was over, “the Colonel” geared up
the carryall to take his young guests across the
prairie to Wolf’s Grove. It was a fresh, bright, blithe
morning, scarcely seven o’clock, when they set out,
and the prairie still glistened with dew. There was
no road to Wolf’s Grove; but the driver took a beeline
over the level ground, and the wheels of the carryall
tracked deep through the sedgy grass and gorgeous
wild flowers.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It looks strange to me,” said Rosalie, “to see
these glorious flowers—which, if they were in our
eastern gardens, we should cherish with so much care—driven
down and crushed by thousands under our
wheels.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is but the sign of the fall of the forest before
the advancing march of immigration,” observed
Mark.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It reminds me, somehow, of the triumphal entries
of the sanguinary old conquerors of ancient times,
whose chariot wheels passed ruthlessly over the fallen,
the dead, and the dying.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mark smiled at her fancy, and the driver took his
pipe out of his mouth, and turned and looked at her
in perplexity.</p>

<p class='c005'>“But, Rose, when you look around you at the
countless millions of flowers left blooming—nay, I
mean to say, when you think of the countless millions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>of trees left standing—does it not give you an exultant
sense of the exhaustless wealth, the boundless resources
of our prairies and forests?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I know <em>something</em> inspires me with unlimited
hope just now. There is, certainly, as far as the comforts
and elegances of civilized life are concerned, a look
of great privation in the village and among the people
we have just left. And yet—and yet—whether
it is because the inhabitants are mostly young and
full of health and hope, or that the houses are all
new, or that the primeval wealth and exuberance of
nature is not only undiminished, but almost untouched;
whether it is any or <em>all</em> of these causes, I do not know,
but certainly to me there is about this country an air
of youth, vigor, hope, promise, unlimited, indescribable!
I feel its influence, without being able to explain
it. It seems to me that here, the age, the weariness,
and the sorrow of the old world has been left
behind. That this is a breaking out in a new place, or
rather that this country and people, and we ourselves,
are a new creation, fresh from the hand of God, and
with a new promise! Let us be faithful to our part of
the covenant. Oh, let us be faithful; let no sin, selfishness,
injustice of ours cause us to lose the glorious
promise!”</p>

<p class='c005'>A pressure of the hand, at once approving, kind,
and warning, from Mark Sutherland, reminded Rosalie
that they were not alone.</p>

<p class='c005'>A little farther on, the sprightly eyes of the girl
lighted upon a large, speckled bird, standing still,
almost in their road.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What a beautiful bird! What is it?” inquired
Rosalie.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>“It’s a prairie chicken. Now, I want you just to
take notice o’ that creetur; it won’t take the trouble
to move—you’ll see,” said the man, driving slowly
past, and leaving the bird behind them, standing
still.</p>

<p class='c005'>“They must be very tame,” said Rosalie.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, they ain’t nyther, but they’ve got a heap o’
sense. We are driving. Now, if I had o’ been afoot
with a gun, or anything that looks like a gun to <em>it</em>—say
a stick—why, it would a-taken wing in a minute.
I’ve took notice of it often and often. Same case with
a deer—it’ll stand right still and look at you going
past with your team; but only just let it catch its eyes
on you when you’re walking ’long o’ your gun, and
it’s off in an instant. Well knowing of that, you see,
I often just quietly lays my gun down in the bottom
of the wagon, to be ready for the creeturs.”</p>

<p class='c005'>In desultory talk like this, which nevertheless gave
our young immigrants some little insight into the
manners of the country, they passed over the three
miles of intervening prairie land, and entered Wolf’s
Grove.</p>

<p class='c005'>Wolf’s Grove was not what its name indicated—an
isolated piece of wood, similar to those that at wide
intervals dotted the prairie; it was rather a portion of
that vast, unbroken, interminable forest, projecting
here into the open prairie like a point of land into the
sea, but stretching back and back hundreds of miles,
and even to the banks of Lake Superior. Here the
old primeval forest trees were of gigantic, almost
fabulous size, but thinly scattered, and standing
singly apart, like the outposts of a vast army.</p>

<p class='c005'>Half a mile within the Grove, where the trees were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>thicker, stood the cabin originally built for a school
and meeting-house, by the first settlers. There was
not a wood-shed, a fence, a fruit tree, nor a foot of
cultivated ground, around it; nor a house, nor a field,
within three miles of it.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mark Sutherland and Rosalie alighted, and entered
the house, while the driver secured his horses and
gave them water. The cabin was unusually large and
well built, being nearly thirty feet square, and constructed
of huge logs, well hewn, and well cemented.
The cabin fronted south, where one door admitted
into the only room; opposite this door, in the north
wall, stood the large, open fire-place. The room was
lighted by two windows, fronting each other, east and
west. The floor was well laid, and a step-ladder in
the corner, between the fire-place and the east window,
led up to a loft. The house was in good repair, with
the single exception of the broken windows.</p>

<p class='c005'>“A very different abode from that you have left,
for my sake, dear Rosalie; and yet, if you only knew,
as I do, how much better this is than any other log
cabin to be found anywhere! Why, Rose, it is a
palace, compared to some.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I know it is; and I only wonder that it has been
left so long untenanted, while the meanest hovels have
been all taken up.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why, you see, my dear, this house is too remote
from the village for any one but a farmer, and as it
stands upon the reserved school lands, of course, no
farmer can cultivate the ground.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Will it not be too far for <em>you</em>?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“With me it is different. I like to walk, and do
not grudge my steps. The three miles’ walk, morning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>and evening, will do me good. Nay, more; that exercise
will be a necessary relief from the sedentary life
of the office. My only anxiety will be in leaving you
here alone, all day. Will you be very lonesome,
dear?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Lonesome? I don’t know. I should be lonesome
<em>anywhere</em> without <em>you</em>, Mark. But that is a very foolish
weakness, and must be overcome, of course.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But you will be afraid to stay here all day long
alone?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Afraid? Of what? Why should I be? Is there
any cause of fear?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, dear; no cause for fear; but, as Emilia said
of jealousy, one might say of fear:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘That fearful souls will not be <em>answered</em> so;</div>
      <div class='line'>They are not ever fearful for a <em>cause</em>,</div>
      <div class='line'>But fearful for they are fearful’”——</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“Well, I am not afraid with or without a cause.
A child would not be afraid in this quiet place,” said
Rosalie, going to one of the windows, and looking out
into the waving woods.</p>

<p class='c005'>“How still—how very still—no sound to be heard
but the rustle of the leaves and the ripple of water,
that must be near!” she continued, looking from the
window, while Mark walked about the room and made
notes of glass, putty, a door latch, and such little
matters that would be needed to be brought out with
their furniture. Then they went out where the driver
stood watering his horses, and where the only sign of
previous human presence was afforded by the narrow
grass-grown path, leading down into a deep dingle,
where the ripple of water was heard.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>“If you’d like a drink, there’s one of the finest
springs in the whole country down there,” said the
landlord, taking a tin cup from the wagon and handing
it to Mark. Rosalie was already going down the path.
They reached the spring, and found the water cold
and clear as crystal. They drank, and congratulated
themselves upon this great blessing, and then went up
to the cabin, and, as their host was in a hurry to
be off they entered the carryall to return to the
village.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, are you going to take it?” asked the driver,
looking around as he took the reins and started.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why, of course. I had <em>already</em> taken it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I knowed <em>that</em>; but I thought when <em>she</em> saw how
lonesome it was, she’d object. ’Tain’t many women—I
can tell you <em>that</em>—who’d agree to live out there, by
themselves, in <em>that</em> lonesome place, and you gone all
day long.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am sure my wife prefers it to an inferior cabin
nearer the village.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, indeed, I do,” said Rosalie.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, every one to their taste,” observed the
landlord, cracking his whip, and making his horses fly.</p>

<p class='c005'>They reached home in good time for dinner.</p>

<p class='c005'>The afternoon was employed by Mark Sutherland
in collecting together necessary provisions, to be taken
with their furniture to the cabin; and by Rosalie—seated
by the window of <em>her</em> part of the upper chamber—in
hemming napkins, preparatory to her housekeeping,
and in looking out upon the prairie basking in
the afternoon sun, and upon her distant home, Wolf’s
Grove.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the evening the hunters returned from an unsuccessful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>expedition; and fatigued and mortified, and
inclined to be silent upon the subject of their defeated
enterprise, they gathered around the supper-table.
But the curiosity of the hostess, and the perseverance
of the host, at last elicited from them the fact that
they had not even hit upon the track of the wolves.</p>

<p class='c005'>The next day was fixed upon by Mark Sutherland
and his wife for their removal to Wolf’s Grove.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XXI.<br> <span class='large'>GOING TO HOUSEKEEPING.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>All the forenoon of the next day, Mr. Garner, the
landlord, was absent with his team; so that our young
people were obliged to defer their removal until the
afternoon; and they spent the intervening hours in
reviewing their possessions and supplying those few
last articles that always are forgotten in a first preparation.</p>

<p class='c005'>At two o’clock, the capacious wagon of the hotel
stood before the door, laden with furniture, trunks,
provisions, and so forth. A tolerable seat was arranged
for Rosalie among the baggage; but Mark, on foot,
accompanied the landlord, who walked at the head
of his horses. It was a slow progress; the horses,
already fatigued with their morning’s work, never got
out of a walk; so that it was nearly four o’clock when
they entered Wolf’s Grove and drew up before the
log cabin. While his horses were resting, Mr. Garner
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>assisted Mark to unlade the wagon, and take in the
furniture and arrange the heaviest part of it. Then,
having watered his horses, he shook hands with his
late guests, wished them good luck, jumped upon his
seat in front of the wagon, and drove off.</p>

<p class='c005'>And Mark and Rosalie found themselves standing,
looking at each other, alone, in the forest cabin. It
was a moment in which flashed back upon each the
memory of their whole past lives, and the intense
realization of their present position. A doubt, whether
to weep or smile, quivered over Rosalie’s features for
an instant. Mark saw the tremor of her lips and eyelids,
and drew her to his heart; and she dropped her
head upon his shoulder and smiled through her tears.
He whispered, cheerily—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Never mind, dear; you will be one of the honoured
pioneer women of the West. And when this wilderness
is a great Commonwealth, and Shelton is a great
city, and I am an old patriarch, we will have much
joy in telling of the log cabin in the wilderness, where
we first went to housekeeping. And now, let us see
if we cannot get this place into a little order.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The room, as I said, was large and square, with a
window east and west, facing each other, and a stone
fire-place north, facing a broad door south. The walls
were unplastered, but well planed and cemented, and
grey with time and use. The floor was of rough but
sound pine plank. A broad shelf over the fire-place
served for a mantel-piece. In the corner between the
east window and the fire-place stood the step-ladder
leading to the loft. In the opposite corner, between
the west window and the fire-place, were three triangular
shelves, that did duty as cupboard or beaufet.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>Finally, the sashes of the windows were good, but the
glass was all broken out of them. This was the state
of the room when Mark and Rosalie looked around
it. Mark went up the step-ladder to examine the
loft, but found it so low that even a woman could
not stand upright in it. It was therefore given up,
except as a place to stow trunks, boxes, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then they began to arrange their furniture. It was
very easily done, they had so little—a bedstead with
its appointments, a table, a half-dozen chairs, and
almost everything else in half-dozens. The form of
the room favoured the convenient arrangement of
these things. The bedstead had already been put up
in the corner between the west window and the door,
and the table placed in the corresponding corner between
the door and the east window. They set the
chairs in their places, and then Mark began to unpack
the china, while Rosalie arranged it on the shelves of
the corner cupboard. There were several things—remnants
of past refinement—out of keeping with
their present condition; among them, the French
china—that looked upon their rough pine shelves as
the elegant Mark Sutherland and the fair and delicate
Rosalie looked in their rude log cabin—and the superb
white Marseilles counterpanes, whose deep fringes
touched the rough plank floor; and the tester and
valance of fine and beautiful net-work; and lastly, the
tamboured curtains that lay upon the chairs, ready to
be put up when Mark should have mended the
windows. These were certainly out of place here, but
it could not be helped; they were Rosalie’s little personal
effects, endeared to her by long possession, and
by their having been the property, and some of them—the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>tamboured curtains and the net valance, for instance—the
<em>handiwork</em> of her mother. By sunset, all
was arranged, except two matters—the broken windows,
with which now the young master of the house
began to employ himself, taking out the sashes and
laying them upon the table, and laying pane after
pane in their places; and the barrel of flour which
stood in the middle of the floor, with a quarter of beef
laid across the top of it—both waiting to be put away
out of sight, in a proper place; that is, supposing a
proper place could be found on premises where there
was neither storehouse, pantry, nor shed, nor even a
second room.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mark busied himself with the window sashes, trying
pane after pane in the empty forms. But at length,
turning around, he smiled and said—</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s no use, Rose; I’m not a glazier, and so carefully
as I thought I measured the sashes and the glass,
they will not exactly fit; and I have no diamond here
to trim them, and so I suppose they must be left until
to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And he replaced the empty sashes in the window
frames. Then, seeing the neglected barrel of flour, he
wheeled it up against the wall, near the door, and said
it must remain there for the present; and Rosalie took
a coarse, clean table-cloth and spread it over the beef,
that still lay upon the top.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And now, dear,” he said, looking around, “I believe
we are as well fixed as we can be for the present.
Nothing remains but to get supper; and, as I was out
here in the West two years before you ever saw it, I
shouldn’t wonder if I hadn’t to give you some instruction.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>“<em>You</em> teach me to cook! <em>I</em>, my uncle’s housekeeper
for two years, while you were wandering about from
town to town!” exclaimed Rosalie.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mark laughed, and bade her remember that when
she was “uncle’s” housekeeper she had experienced
cooks at her command, and that her housekeeping
duties and responsibilities consisted in carrying the
keys and ordering what she pleased to have for dinner.
And he further advised her to recollect that she was
not to snap up her liege lord in that way, either!
Whereupon Rose bade him mind his business and his
briefs; for that she should snap him, and box his ears,
too, whenever the spirit moved her. She! Mark
snatched her, laughing, to his bosom, and half suffocated
her with kisses, and then holding her tight, bade
her do her wickedest.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And, Rose,” he exclaimed merrily, “I do not
know why it is; but out here, in this cabin of the
wilderness, with nobody but you for company, I feel
as if the restraints of society and of maturity had
fallen away, and restored me to the freedom and the
wilfulness and the irresponsible wickedness of my
boyhood. And <em>oh!</em> little one, if you were only a
great deal taller and stronger, what a wrestle we would
have!”</p>

<p class='c005'>And he gazed down on her there, standing within
his arms—so small, so fair, so perfectly helpless, so
utterly in his power—and all the wantonness of youth
fled from before her helplessness and her beauty,
and a flood of unutterable tenderness rushed over his
heart; and, still gazing upon her with infinite love, he
said—</p>

<p class='c005'>“God forever bless you—you little, little, wee thing;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>you delicate, beautiful creature; and God forever forsake
me, if ever, willingly, I give you a moment’s pain
or sorrow!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Blushing deeply, Rose withdrew herself from his
now yielding clasp, and, to cover her girlish embarrassment,
took the new bucket and put it in his hands,
requesting him to go to the spring, and bring her
fresh water to fill the tea-kettle, and adding—</p>

<p class='c005'>“You shall see what nice biscuits and what nice tea
I can make.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mark took the pail and went out, and disappeared
down the path.</p>

<p class='c005'>Rosalie, observing the floor littered, looked around
for the broom to sweep it up; and then laughed
to find that, with all their getting, they had got no
<em>broom</em>.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mark came in with the pail of water, set it down,
and said he would go and get some brush to kindle a
fire. And while he was gone, Rosalie put water in a
basin to wash her hands preparatory to making the
biscuits; and <em>then</em> she discovered that they had forgotten
<em>soap</em> also. And while she stood in dismay,
wondering what else might have been omitted, Mark
re-entered with a pile of brush on his shoulders, “like
Christian with his bundle of sin,” he said. He threw
it down upon the hearth, and began to look around,
and then he broke into a gay, prolonged laugh.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What’s the matter, Mark? Are you daring to
laugh at me, with my sleeves and skirt tucked up?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“O, Rosalie, we have heads, child! we have heads—and
so have cabbages, when they have come to
maturity.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>“Well, don’t laugh <em>yours</em> off your shoulders, but
tell me what you’re laughing <em>at</em>!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“We have not brought a match nor a candle.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh! no! You don’t say so?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is a positive fact.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“We have forgotten soap and brooms too; we have
forgotten <em>every</em>thing.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, not <em>every</em>thing; only a few things that make
everything useless.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What’s to be done? We can’t cook supper to-night,
or even breakfast to-morrow morning, without
a fire.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No. Let’s see—I know if one rubs two pieces of
wood together long enough, they will ignite; and I
know of other processes by which fire may be kindled;
but, after all, I think the quickest and the surest way
will be for me to go back to Shelton this evening,
and get the matches; and then I can also get soap,
a broom, and my pistols, which were likewise forgotten.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Go back to Shelton this evening! Walk three
miles to Shelton, and back this evening, and the sun
already down! You will be tired to death.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, dear; I can walk that three miles in about an
hour, get the things in ten minutes; borrow Mr.
Garner’s saddle-horse to ride back, and take him home
again in the morning, when I go to the office. And
my brave little girl will not be afraid to stay here a
a few hours by herself?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Afraid? No; surely not.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You can fasten the door with this wooden pin, if
you wish to do so.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh! I shall not wish to fasten the door. I shall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>sit on the sill and watch the stars, and see if I can
read our future destiny on their orbs, and wait for
the moon to rise, and for you to come.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, you must not do that, Rose. The woods are
damp, and the evening air chill. And, now I think
of it, this cabin will be too cool for you, with this
draught through the open windows. Let’s see if we
cannot do something with them. If you had anything
to tack up against them, Rosalie?”</p>

<p class='c005'>She went to a box and took out two sheets, each of
which, doubled, was tacked against a window, and because
the breeze still lifted them, a few tacks were
driven in the sides and bottoms of these temporary
blinds, to keep them down. Having finished that job,
Mark pulled down and buttoned his wristbands, put
on his coat, kissed Rosalie, bade her keep up her heart,
for that he should be back at ten, or a little after,
and departed. She stood at the door, watching him,
until he disappeared within the intervening trees, and
then she turned and entered the darkening house.</p>

<p class='c005'>Did Mark Sutherland—did Rosalie—dream of all
that should happen before they should meet again?
Did either imagine the grim horror of the next few
hours? It was a night that <em>one</em> of them never, in after
life, forgot—whose fearful memory haunted thoughts
by day, and visions by night, when the dreamer would
start from sleep, and, with convulsive shivers and cold
perspiration, gaze around in terror that could not be
reassured.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XXII.<br> <span class='large'>A NIGHT OF FEAR.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Rosalie entered the house, and shut the door behind
her. It was very dark, for twilight had departed,
and the moon had not yet arisen. Although the door
and windows were closed, the room was still sufficiently
cool, and Rosalie might have remained pleasantly
seated in her sole rocking-chair, and wrapped in
reverie, through all the lonely hours until her husband
should return, but for one trifling circumstance; trifling
in itself, yet fraught with the most appalling danger,
and the most ghastly consequences. The fresh
carnal smell of that quarter of newly-killed beef that
lay across the top of the barrel, only lightly covered
over with the table-cloth, began to fill the closed room,
and soon became intolerable to Rosalie’s fine senses.</p>

<p class='c005'>For the sake of fresh, pure air, she went and opened
the door, and sat down upon the door step. There
she sat, gazing into the dark mysterious depths of the
forest, or up to the deep blue, starlit sky, listening to
the chirp of the field-cricket, the grass-hopper, and the
katydid, those merry little night warblers, who begin
their concerts when the birds have finished theirs—and
remembering all her past life, enjoying her present,
and dreaming and hoping of the future. She
thought of her palace home, where, circled with affection,
she had still wandered with a strange unrest, and
wasted with a vague longing; she thought of her present
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>home, as poor, as humble, as rude, as it well could
be, yet yielding a fulness of content—of <em>measureless</em>
content—that filled her heart to overflowing with gratitude
and love to God for the joy and peace that
abounded. And she thought of their future; it might
bring toil, privation, penury, disappointment, and
death, but it could not deprive her of the jewel of her
soul, <span class='fss'>LOVE</span>. That word—that idea—was still the centre
of her soul’s circle, around which thought and feeling
still revolved. She sank into a dim, delicious reverie,
and, wrapped in blissful dreams, the world around
her disappeared. The cheerful chirp of the crickets
and the katydids was no longer heard—the deep blue,
starlit sky no longer watched—the dark, mysterious
forest, with its ever untrodden depths, no longer seen.
She was like a slumberer “smiling as in delightful
visions, on the brink of a dread chasm.” There was
a far-off, light, multitudinous tramp, like the patter
of distant rain-drops. She knew it not, she heard it
not. “Senseless as the dead was she, to all around,
beneath, above.” Senseless as the dead—aye, senseless
as the dead—to the near approach of a dreadful
death! Oh, surely this was not her unguarded hour!
She would not be left to perish in her youth and
beauty—to perish while wrapped in her visions of
love and devotion. Oh, surely her guardian angel
must have been at his post. He was! For, as she sat
there in the door, her thin white dress distinct in the
darkness, her fair pale face bowed on her hand, and
her beautiful light hair damp with dew—a shudder
thrilled her frame. She arose, and, shivering with a
damp chillness, retired into the house; but before she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>shut the door, she turned her eyes once more from
earth to sky, and—</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is a most beautiful night,” she said; “a lovely
night, ‘not made for sleep.’”</p>

<p class='c005'>A singular low noise caught her ear, and ceased.</p>

<p class='c005'>“That sounds like a sudden fall of rain stopped,” she
said, and paused to listen. Not hearing the noise
again, she closed the door; and without in the least
degree intending to do it, quite mechanically she did
the wisest thing that could have been done. She
<em>barred</em> the door, and then she seated herself once more
in the rocking-chair. The room was intensely dark.
The faint light that stole in at the sheeted window
only seemed a thinner blackness. She sat gently
rocking to and fro, and gradually relapsing into
reverie.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was soon rudely broken through. Still like the
sudden heavy fall of rain-drops on forest leaves, multitudinous
footsteps thronged pattering around the
cabin—pawing at its walls! Startled, astonished, yet
not alarmed, Rosalie listened. Then a low ground
swell of a growl arose, murmuring on the air, and
thrilling every nerve with awe. It was low, deep, and
threatening, as the thrilling bass string of the harpsichord
when rudely swept by some idler’s hand.
Rosalie stood up; and, resting her hand upon the
rocking-chair, listened more intently. The sound
ceased—all was still as death. She crept cautiously
to the window, and, pulling aside slightly the edge of
the sheet-blind, where it was tacked to the side of the
frame, she looked out. The night was deeply dark,
though the sky was still studded with stars—<em>the ground
was also lighted with stars</em>—twin stars, scattered all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>about. At first sight she took these for lightning-bugs;
but, as she gazed, she knew them to be the
phosphoric, excited eyes of couchant wild beasts.
And, at the same instant that she made this appalling
discovery, the whole pack burst, in full cry, upon the
cabin, tearing at the walls, and howling furiously with
hunger, rage, and frantic desire. Rosalie tottered
back to her chair, and sank into it. The whole
horrible truth, in all its detail of cause, effect, and
consequence, burst with overwhelming force upon her
senses. It was a pack of hungry wolves!—the same
pack that the Indian hunters had pursued into the
neighbourhood of Shelton—the same pack that had
been the terror of the settlement since their discovery
near it. They had been drawn to the cabin by the
scent of blood from the newly-killed beef, and there
was no light in the house to fright them off. Sick—oh,
sick, and nearly swooning with deadly terror—Rosalie
still charged her soul “to hold her body
strengthened” for the crisis.</p>

<p class='c005'>She looked around in the darkness, trying to think
of some means of defence, security, or escape, but
found none. If she should open the door and fly from
the house, she must inevitably fall an instant victim
to their rapacity. That plan was rejected at once, as
not to be thought of, except as the drowning think of
catching at straws. And then her eyes flew wildly
around in the darkness for means of defence or retreat.
Alas! there was not a chance of either. She could
go up into the loft, or climb up into the chimney, or
bury herself in the bed; but an instant’s reflection
convinced her that there was no place within the walls
to which the fell wolves would not climb with more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>facility than she could, and no retreat to which their
keen scent would not guide them, and from which
they would not drag her to death. And oh! in the
midst of all her desperate thoughts, their frantic onsets
to the walls, their horrible baying, barking, and tearing,
nearly drove her mad with terror. Every instant
she expected death! How thin, how slight the barrier
that kept them out! The moment they should chance
to strike the broken windows, protected only by the
thin sheets, and so find the way of entrance, that very
moment must the cabin be filled by the hungry and
ravening beasts. For an instant, perhaps, the beef,
whose scent had drawn them to the spot, might
divert them from herself, but only for an instant, for
that flesh would be swiftly torn in pieces and devoured;
and then what a fate would be hers! To perish so
sharply and suddenly, and by such a ghastly death!
And not of herself alone did she think in that hour of
dread, but of all whom her death would appal and
afflict; and of him, oh! of him whom it would most
awfully bereave. For herself—for her own person—it
would not be so dreadful, after all, she thought.
The sharp agony would soon be over—in a very few
minutes most likely—and then all that was mortal and
perishable of her—her small, frail body—would be
totally destroyed; and her soul, she trusted, would be
at rest. But, of the distant loved ones, whose hearts
would thrill with horror at hearing of her fate, and
of him whose life would be made desolate by her loss—whose
arm, whose <em>brain</em> would be stricken powerless
by the terrible doom of her who was at once his
inspiration and his object—this, oh! <em>this</em> was the bitterness
of death! But oh! the frightful, the maddening
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>howls of the demoniacs outside scattered all
her thoughts so quickly, it was impossible to reflect
to any good end. But suddenly athwart the stormy
chaos of deafening noise, despairing terror, and distracting
thought, darted, like lightning, an inspiration!
She had grown conscious that the storm outside
had drawn itself to a point nearest the spot where
the barrel and the meat stood; and the wolves were
scratching and tearing furiously, and hurling themselves
at the wall, baying all the while in full cry, or
barking and fighting among themselves, like demons.
And now her idea was further to decoy them from
the windows, the weak parts of the cabin. She went
to the barrel. She could not lift the quarter of beef,
but she pushed it off, letting it fall heavily upon the
floor. For an instant the noise outside ceased, but
soon burst forth again with renewed violence. She
dragged the beef close as she could get it to the door,
and then she got a knife, and close to the floor she
cut the flesh in gashes, so that the juices might run
under the door to the outside, and draw and hold the
frantic wolves to that spot. For this she knew was
the safest place of attack—it was the farthest removed
from the windows, and the door was too strong and
well barred to give way. She knew this, but yet
when it rattled violently at their furious assaults, her
very heart nearly died within her.</p>

<p class='c005'>She thought of her husband’s return with extreme
anxiety; she feared full as much as she hoped it. She
had perfect faith in his courage and presence of mind,
and she knew, besides, he would be well armed when
he should return; and yet she sickened with fear for
him when she thought of that return. She remembered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>that he said he would be back by ten. She wished to
know the hour. It was still pitch dark, but she went
to the chimney shelf, and opened the clock, and with
her delicate fingers and nice touch she felt for the
hour and the minute hands, and for the raised figures,
and ascertained that it was already after ten. She felt
again, and was sure there was no mistake. After ten,
and Mark not yet returned! What could have detained
him? This source of anxiety was beginning to add
its sting to the others, when a new ground of alarm,
of despair, fixed her panic-stricken where she stood.
The wolves, who had not ceased to howl and cry, and
hurl themselves against the walls, now led by a surer
instinct, were careering around and around the cabin,
leaping up at the walls, and leaping up at the window sashes,
which shook at each bound! The clamour outside
was now deafening, appalling. She heard the
frail sashes shake—she heard them give way—she
heard the whole hungry, horrible pack burst with full
cry into the room; and mortal terror whirled away
her consciousness, and, with an agonizing cry to
Heaven, she fell to the floor insensible.</p>

<hr class='c018'>

<p class='c005'>When consciousness came back, Rosalie found
herself lying upon her bed. The room was quiet,
cool, and dimly lighted by a candle on the hearth,
whose glare was shaded from her eyes by an intervening
chair with a shawl thrown over it. Mark was
standing by her, bathing her face with cold water.
As memory returned, she shuddered violently several
times; and her first words, gasped out, were, “The
wolves! Oh! the wolves!”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>“They are gone, love; put to flight!” said Mark
Sutherland, soothingly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And you—<em>you</em>?” she asked, wildly gazing at
him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Safe, as you see, love!” he answered, as he lifted
her head, and placed a glass of cold water to her
lips.</p>

<p class='c005'>“How did it happen, Mark?” she questioned, as he
laid her head once more upon the pillow.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What happen, love?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My escape, your safety, and the flight of the
wolves.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dear Rose, we had better not revert to the subject
again to-night. Try to compose yourself.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I cannot! If I close my eyes and lie still, I hear
again those dreadful howls—I see again those glaring
eyes and ghastly fangs—I live over again the terrible
danger.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My dear Rosalie, there was really no very great
danger, and it was all over as soon as I reached the
spot with fire-arms,” said Mark, calmly, and wishing
to depreciate the peril she had passed, and restore her
to quietness.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yet tell me about it—if you will talk to me
about the escape I shall not brood over the appalling”——</p>

<p class='c005'>She shuddered, and was silent.</p>

<p class='c005'>“There is really very little to tell, Rosalie. As I approached
the house on my return home I heard the
howling of the wolves. I surmised the truth instantly—that
they were the same pack the neighbours
had been after for the last few days—that the smell
of the fresh meat we had brought over the prairie and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>into the forest had decoyed them to the cabin, from
whence there was no light to scare them. I hurried
on as fast as possible, and soon came upon the cabin,
and found a pack of perhaps a dozen wolves baying
around the house, and leaping and scratching at the
walls. They were prairie wolves—a small, cowardly
race—who go in packs, and who are generally very
easily driven off. I first of all picked up and threw a
billet of wood at them. I forgot, dear Rose, that our
window had no better defence than a sheet, or else I
never thought of it at all, for when I threw the piece
of wood, it not only passed through the pack of wolves,
but on through the window-place, too—scattering the
animals, but also making an opening, through which
several of them, in their efforts to escape, leaped into
the house”——</p>

<p class='c005'>“It was then I fainted,” said Rosalie.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I found you lying on the floor, insensible.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But you and the wolves?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“A very short skirmish served to put the enemy to
flight. I succeeded in killing only two of them—two
that had leaped before me in at the window—the others
escaped.”</p>

<p class='c005'>As Rosalie continued to tremble, he added:</p>

<p class='c005'>“They are really not a formidable antagonist, my
dear. I have heard a pioneer say, that he would as
lief as not tumble himself, unarmed, down into a
dingle full of them, and trust to his muscular strength
and courage to conquer. That might have been all
boasting; still I know they are a dastardly race; and
if you had known it, and could have raised great
noise, and thrown some heavy missiles among them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>from the loft above, you would have put them all to
flight.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ah, but if they had got in while I lay here insensible
from terror, they would have destroyed me,”
thought Rosalie. But, unwilling to give pain, she
withheld the expression of those terrible thoughts.</p>

<p class='c005'>More words of soothing influence Mark dropped
into her ear, until at length her spirits were calmed,
and she was enabled to join him in earnest thanksgiving
to Heaven for their preservation. He fanned
her till she dropped asleep. And then, late as it was,
he went and busied himself with many things that
remained to be done—putting glass in the windows,
cutting up and salting down the nearly fatal quarter
of beef, ripping off the head of the barrel of flour,
&#38;c.—and doing all so quietly as not to disturb the
sleeper.</p>

</div>

<p class='c004'>A night’s undisturbed repose restored Rosalie’s
exhausted nervous energy. The young couple arose
early in the morning to begin their first day of house,
or rather <em>cabin</em>-keeping, for the difference of style
requires a difference of term. They had anticipated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>toil and privation, and had thought they were prepared
to meet them. But it is one thing to think in
a general way about work and want, and quite another
to feel them in all their irritating and exhausting
details; and the first day of housekeeping in the forest
log cabin taught them this difference. They had no
garden, no cow, no poultry, and there was no market
where to procure the necessaries that these should
have supplied. Everything that could be bought at
the village shops had been provided; yet their first
breakfast consisted of coffee without cream or milk,
and biscuits without butter. But mutual love, and
hope, and trust, sweetened the meal, and even their
little privations furnished matters of jest. And when
breakfast was over, and Mark was preparing to bid
his “little sweetheart,” as he called her, farewell for
the day, and promising to return by four o’clock, she
gaily asked him what he would <em>like</em> for dinner, and he
replied by ordering a bill of fare, that <em>might</em> have been
furnished by some famous Eastern or European hotel.
Suddenly, in the midst of their merriment, she thought
of the wolves and trembled—yet restrained the expression
of her fears. But the eye of affection read her
thoughts, and Mark hastened to assure her that there
was no more to dread—that the cabin was the last
place on earth that the same animals would seek again—that
they would not come within sight of its smoking
chimney. Her trust in his judgment and his
truthfulness completely reassured her doubting heart,
and set it at perfect rest. And she let him go to his
business with a gay, glad smile.</p>

<p class='c005'>She watched him winding up the little narrow path,
and disappearing among the trees, and then she turned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>into the house, to wash up the breakfast service and
set the room in order. It was a queer day—that first
one that she spent alone in her cabin. After arranging
her corner cupboard and sweeping her room, and
making a few little alterations and improvements in
the disposition of her lighter furniture, she unpacked
her sewing materials and sat down in the door to
needlework. The primeval forest all around her,
even up to the house, the blue sky above, and the log
cabin, in the door of which she sat, was all that met
the eye; the trilling songs of the wood birds, and the
ripple-ripple of the trickling spring in the deep dell
near, was all that met the ear. And yet she was not
lonesome—she loved this solitude—the manifest presence
of God filled it, and heart and mind received
the holy, the elevating, the joyous influence. The
day advanced—the sparkling freshness of the morning
mellowed into noon. And then she got up and took
a pitcher and went down to the spring, that seemed
to have been calling her in its merry voice all the
morning. A narrow, steep path down into the dingle
led to the spring, and beyond it arose a high hill,
heavily wooded, like all the land about there. She
filled her pitcher, and returned to the house to take
her lonely noontide luncheon. And then, as the
meridian sun was pouring its rays in at the door,
which you know faced the south, she removed her
needlework to the west window, and resumed her
sewing. Day waned; nor was she conscious of its
waning until the burning sun began to glance in at
her through the window where she sat, and oblige
her to take her work to the opposite one—smiling at
the conceit of being chased from place to place by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>Apollo. She sat at the cool east window, until the
striking of the clock warned her that it was time to
prepare the afternoon meal, which was to comprise
“dinner and supper together.” She arose, and put
away her work. But what was there to be got for
dinner, after all? Tea without milk, bread without
butter, and salted beef without vegetables. A poor
meal certainly to set before an epicurean, such as
Mr. Sutherland had been, for of <em>herself</em> she never
thought.</p>

<p class='c005'>Suddenly she recollected having seen some wild
plum trees growing on the hill beyond the spring,
and she knew the fruit should now be ripe, and she
thought she would go and get some, to make a pie.
No sooner thought than attempted. She seized her
bonnet, caught up a little basket, and set out. She
hastened down the dingle path, crossed the run, and
climbed the hill. She reached its summit, and stopped
to breathe, and rest for a moment. The sudden glory
of the extended landscape held her spell-bound. On
one side of the forest—a boundless ocean of waving
greenery—spreading on and on, thousands of miles,
for aught she knew, after it was lost under the horizon.
On the other side, the vast prairie, with its dotted
groves, like oases in desert, and in the distance the
river, and the village, and the opposite shore of Missouri
Territory. For a few minutes she stood in enchanted
admiration; and then, remembering that she
had no time to lose, addressed herself to the errand
upon which she came, promising herself, after tea,
when they should be at leisure, to return with Mark,
and view the landscape over by moonlight. The wild
plum trees furnished a rich harvest. She had only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>to shake the slight and graceful shaft, and a shower
of ripe fruit fell around her. She quickly filled her
basket; and then, with her girlish love of change, she
returned to the house by another way. By this little
route through the thicket, she observed, late as it was
in the season, a profusion of wild raspberries, of unusual
size and richness. She stopped, in pleased surprise,
to gather them, and heaped them up on top of
the plums, as many as the basket would hold.</p>

<p class='c005'>Delighted with these woodland treasures—such a
delicious addition to her frugal board—she returned
to the cabin, and began to prepare their evening meal.
Rosalie had not superintended her uncle’s Virginia
farm-house for two years, to no purpose. She was a
skilful little cook. It was not much to prepare a meal
twice a day, for two persons; besides, her “good will
was to it.” And I doubt if, in all the elegance and
luxury of her Southern home, she was ever gayer,
gladder, <em>happier</em>, than when preparing, with her own
hands, this first little supper in her log cabin. The
meal was soon ready. The damask table linen and
the delicate china that adorned the table, and the fair
girl that hovered around it, I was about to say, were
somewhat out of keeping with the house. But that
would not have been true; for there was nothing
mean, poor, or squalid, in the surroundings of the log
cabin. It had a wild, woodland air—there was as yet
nothing to offend the most æsthetic taste. The arrangement
of the table was complete—the last things set
upon it being the delicate pastry and the cut-glass
bowl of raspberries, powdered with sugar. But, there
was no cream or butter; and this was Rosalie’s sole
regret, as she gave a pleased glance at the whole effect,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>and then went to each window, and put aside the
muslin curtains to let in the evening breeze, and the
green woodland prospect. As she turned from the
window, she was startled by a thump upon the floor,
and the exclamation of—</p>

<p class='c005'>“<em>There!</em> she sent you <em>these</em>! And I wonder why
you couldn’t o’ comed arter them yourself!”</p>

<p class='c005'>And with astonishment Rosalie saw standing in the
room a large, fair-complexioned, middle-aged man,
clothed in coarse blue linen jacket and trousers, with
a waiter’s white apron tied before him. He had just
thumped on the floor a large basket filled with vegetables.
He still held in his hand a tin pail, with a tin
pan covered upon the top of it.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Who are you?” inquired she.</p>

<p class='c005'>“<em>Billy.</em> Here’s the butter. Where am I to pour
the milk?” said the man, lifting the little pan that
contained a pound print, and displaying half a gallon
of milk in the pail.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Who sent these?” asked Rose, in surprise.</p>

<p class='c005'>“<em>She!</em> Can’t you empty the milk? I’ve got to
carry the bucket back.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am afraid there is some mistake,” said Rose, hesitating.
“Who did you say sent you?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“<em>Her</em>, I tell you. I can’t stand here gablin’ all
day.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But, my good friend, there is some error—these
things were not sent to me,” persisted Rosalie, looking
longingly at the hard, sweet-smelling butter, with the
dew rising on it.</p>

<p class='c005'>With no more ado, “Billy” marched up to the
corner cupboard, seized a knife, passed it under the
print of butter, and deftly turned the print out of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>pan into a plate; next, he took up the pail and poured
the milk into a pitcher; finally, he went back and
seized his basket, and seeing nothing, to receive the
vegetables, just turned it upside down and shook them
out upon the floor—and potatoes, cucumbers, onions,
tomatoes, &#38;c., rolled in every direction. And “Billy”
caught up his empty pan and pail and pitched them
into the basket, and hitched the latter, with a jerk,
upon his arm, and marched out of the door, exclaiming—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now, for the futur’, mind, you must come arter
’em every day, yourself—if they’re worth havin’ they’re
worth comin’ for, an’ I’ve got ’nough to do for <em>her</em>,
’out trudgin’ over here every day for <em>you</em>. An’ I
told her I wan’t agoin’ to do it, nuther,” &#38;c.,
&#38;c., &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c005'>For long after Billy was out of sight in the woods,
Rosalie heard the retreating sound of his grumbling.
Full of wonder, she set about to collect the fugitive
potatoes, tomatoes, &#38;c. She put them under the lower
shelf of her cupboard, and drew the short white curtain
before them; then she set the pitcher of rich milk
and the plate of fresh butter upon the table, much
pleased with the unexpected luxury, but more pleased
to anticipate the surprise and pleasure of Mark. And
all being ready, she took her sewing, and sat in the
door to watch for his coming. She heard his footstep
before she saw his form; and she closed the door and
ran up the woodland path to meet him. And soon
their merry voices and silvery laughter echoed through
the forest, as they approached the cabin. Rosalie had
said nothing of her new luxuries; and when they
entered the cabin, and he threw a glance around, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>dropped his eyes upon the table, first of all he caught
and kissed Rose again for her affectionate care, and
then, by his exclamations and questions, exhibited all
the surprise and satisfaction that the most exacting
little Rose could have desired. While they supped,
Rosalie explained the mystery of the plums and raspberries,
and, after relating the visit of Billy, requested
an explanation of the other mystery, of the butter,
milk, and vegetables, and expressed her fears that,
after all, she had no right to them—that they were
intended for some one else. Mark reassured her by
giving his opinion that they were intended for herself,
and no other; and that she would find out, the
next day, probably, the kind neighbour who had sent
them.</p>

<p class='c005'>After supper was over and cleared away, and the
young pair had rested awhile, and the moon had risen,
they crossed the rill and went up the hill to enjoy the
fine air and the extended view.</p>

<p class='c005'>And thus closed their first day at the log cabin.</p>

<p class='c005'>And the next morning Rosalie found out her kind
neighbours.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>The next morning, after breakfast, while sitting
alone in her cabin, engaged, as usual, in needlework,
Rosalie received a call from her kind neighbour, Mrs.
Attridge, whom she found to be the wife of the worthy
proprietor of the neighbouring lead-smelting furnace.
“Fat, fair, and forty,” with a fund of good nature and
good humour, in easy circumstances, and with much
experience in Western life, this lady proved an invaluable
acquisition to Rosalie in the era of her cabin
trials. Her frank, gay, and homely manner invited
confidence. She pressed upon her young neighbour
the freedom of her garden and her dairy, for as long
as the latter chose to avail herself of the privilege, or
until she should have cows and a garden of her own—telling
her that it was the custom of the settlers to
accommodate each other in that way, and that she
herself, in the first year of her residence here, had
been indebted to a neighbour for her milk and vegetables.
Talking of vegetables, led to the subject of
“Billy,” whom Mrs. Attridge laughingly averred to
be a vegetable himself, for verdancy. Billy, she said,
was a native of Holland, brought over to America in
his infancy, and left a destitute orphan, whom her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>mother had taken and brought up, but whose peculiarity
of disposition and simplicity of character was
such as fitted him only for house-work. She said that,
on the death of his first mistress, Billy had attached
himself to the fortunes of herself and husband, and
had accompanied them to the West, and had been
their only house servant ever since—cooking, cleaning,
washing, and ironing, as well as any woman could.</p>

<p class='c005'>Rosalie was amused, cheered, and comforted, by
Mrs. Attridge’s lively conversation and kind sympathy—yet
during the lady’s visit, a case that had troubled
the youthful wife for several days still weighed upon
her spirits and cast its gloom over her countenance,
and refused to be shaken off.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mrs. Attridge, with a housekeeper’s sympathy and
a woman’s tact, divined the cause, and with rude but
kind promptitude drew the trouble out to light, by
suddenly asking—</p>

<p class='c005'>“What do you intend to do about your <em>washing</em>, my
dear?—for it is all nonsense to suppose that you could
wash.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is, indeed,” said Rosalie; “and that is just what
disturbs me so. I can manage to keep our cabin tidy,
and dress our little meals; but I cannot wash—indeed,
I cannot. I attempted to do so, but, after having exhausted
all my strength, and made myself almost ill,
I failed. And when I know that every pioneer housekeeper
needs to be competent to the performance of
<em>all</em> her domestic duties, I feel thoroughly ashamed of
my helplessness in some respects. And when I see
my husband so patient and cheerful under domestic
annoyances that no day-labourer with an efficient
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>helpmate ever has to suffer—oh! you know I must
feel so cruelly disappointed in myself.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mrs. Attridge made no comment, but looked upon
her young neighbour with a considerate, fond, protective
expression on her honest countenance. And
after a few minutes, Rosalie spoke again—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Can you advise me what to do, Mrs. Attridge?
for I have resolved that, in our present circumstances,
my husband shall be put to no expense for these
matters.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh! pshaw! you can never do it; and some other
plan must be thought of,” said the visitor, reflectively.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, it is real incapacity on my part—a want of
the requisite physical strength. I am not constitutionally
weak; but the muscles of my arms and chest
have never been trained to great or continued exertion,
and strengthened by that process—more is the
pity! Look at my wrists.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And Rosalie, smilingly, tearfully, held out two
delicate, fair, tapering arms. And Mrs. Attridge took
and held them affectionately, while she said—</p>

<p class='c005'>“I know—I know it would be useless and cruel to
expect hard work of you; and yet the expense
oughtn’t to come on <em>him</em>, neither, just now. I have
been thinking, since I sat here, of an Irish family of
the name of Malony, who live in a shanty about a
quarter of a mile from this, on my road home. The
man works at our furnace, and the woman washes for
bachelors. Now, although they are thriving, she and
her family are always ragged, because she is as ignorant
as a savage of the use of a needle; and, besides,
she says she hasn’t time to sew. Now,” said Mrs.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>Attridge, half laughingly, as she arose to depart,
“suppose you were to barter work with Judy Malony,
and pay her for washing by making up clothing
for her children? At any rate, I will call and
see Judy on my way home, and send her over to
you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Rosalie cordially thanked her kind friend, and
held her hand, and felt unwilling to allow her to
depart.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I shall send Billy over with more fresh milk this
evening. And you must not mind his <em>grumbling</em>—he
grumbles at me and Mr. Attridge all day long
sometimes, and won’t allow us to touch a thing in
the garden till he thinks proper, without a <em>deal</em> of
grumbling.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mrs. Attridge, after promising Rosalie to walk
over and see her often, and spend whole days
whenever it was possible, took leave, and departed.</p>

<p class='c005'>That evening Mark Sutherland returned home
sooner than usual. His countenance was cheerful
with good news, and he threw into Rosalie’s lap a
packet of letters and papers from home—the first that
had been received since their separation from their
friends.</p>

<p class='c005'>There was a letter from Colonel Ashley, full
of kind wishes, and something more substantial
in the shape of a cheque on the St. Louis bank,
for his niece. He informed them that he was again
alone—that his son, St. Gerald, having lost his
election, had, under the disappointment, yielded to
the wishes of his wife, and taken her to her Southern
home; and that he expected his own eldest daughter,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>now a widow, to return and take the direction of his
household.</p>

<p class='c005'>There was also a letter from Valeria to Rose, and
one from Lincoln to Mark.</p>

<p class='c005'>By these letters they learned that Mr. and Mrs.
Lauderdale had joined the Ashleys at Cashmere, and
remained the guests of Clement Sutherland for a
month before proceeding to their own home in
Louisiana.</p>

<p class='c005'>Valeria wrote that the Valley of the Pearl was still
the loveliest vale on earth, and Cashmere the brightest
gem on its bosom; but that the envied master of this
Eden was more sullen, morose, and unhappy than
ever—that it was rumoured his affairs were not as
prosperous as before—that he had engaged in ruinous
speculations—that Mr. St. Gerald Ashley, since losing
his election, had lost his good temper and amiability,
and sought more consolation from his “generous wine”
than from his unloving wife—that all these circumstances
weighed heavily upon the health and spirits
of the beautiful India, who had changed sadly within
the last few months. The kind-hearted but volatile
Valeria touched lightly and reluctantly upon these
unhappy circumstances, and seemed always divided
between her spirit of communicativeness and her
scruples of conscience.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mark Sutherland and Rosalie read with regret, and
turned from the sad contemplation with a sense of
relief to rest gladly upon the image of Valeria and
Lincoln Lauderdale, now happily settled upon their
beautiful estate of Fairplains, in Louisiana. Withal
this was a happy evening to the young cottagers—a
festival of gladness, such as can be fully enjoyed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>only by exiles, feasting upon long-desired letters from
home.</p>

<p class='c005'>The next day Rosalie was somewhat surprised to
receive a visit from Judy, and very well satisfied to
effect with her an arrangement by which Judy was to
do all the washing and ironing for Rosalie, who was
to repay her by making up frocks and aprons for her
children. And so, before the end of the first week of
housekeeping, Rosalie’s domestic circumstances were
providentially arranged in all the order and comfort
consistent with log-cabin life.</p>

<p class='c005'>It would seem a lonely life she led now, yet Rosalie
found it not so. The solitude was peopled with her
multitudinous rich affections, high purposes, and
bright hopes of the future. Through the day she
sang at her active household work, or fell into pleasing
reverie over her needle. In the afternoon, when Mark
returned, they partook of an early supper, rested, and
then took a pleasant woodland walk, or occupied the
evening hours with a book.</p>

<p class='c005'>On the first Sabbath Mrs. Attridge called in her carryall
to offer the young couple the two vacant seats to
church; a favour which, after some little hesitation
and reflection, they frankly and gratefully accepted.
And, afterwards, Mark Sutherland was much pleased
when it fell in the way of his profession to do Mr.
Attridge a gratuitous service—a favour which it was
rather difficult to make honest Paul Attridge accept,
who answered to all Mr. Sutherland’s grateful acknowledgments
and expostulations,</p>

<p class='c005'>“That neighbours should be neighbours, but that
professional men should be paid for their services.”</p>

<p class='c005'>As passed the week, so passed the autumn, bringing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>little change in the circumstances of our young friends.
Mr. Sutherland gained admittance to the bar; but as
yet his professional duties were confined exclusively
to office business, the drawing up of deeds, bonds, mortgages,
&#38;c. And this was not profitable. Indeed, many
of his best-meaning neighbours strongly advised him
to take up government land, and turn his attention to
agriculture. But this Rosalie opposed with all her
might, encouraging him to be constant to his profession
as he was to his wife—“for better for worse, for
richer for poorer.” She alone, suppressing all complaint
and concealing all her personal privations, continued
to cheer and strengthen the struggler. She
alone had an invincible faith in his future—his future
of greatness and wide usefulness.</p>

<p class='c005'>Autumn waned, and the severe winter of those latitudes
approached. Early in December a heavy fall of
snow covered the ground two or three feet in depth,
rendering the road almost impassable between Wolf’s
Grove and Shelton, and nearly blockading our friends
in their log cabin. It was with the greatest difficulty
that Mark Sutherland performed the three miles’ journey
from his home to his office, and Rosalie was a close
prisoner in her house.</p>

<p class='c005'>The snow lay on the ground several weeks, during
which time the hardships and privations of the young
couple were so numerous and so great as to determine
them to seize the earliest opportunity of removing into
town; and Mark accordingly sought a house in Shelton.
And having found one vacated by a family about to
emigrate to Arkansas, he rented it at once, and availed
himself of the first favourable change in the weather
to remove to town and take possession of it.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>Their removal took place the first of January. A
return to the society of her fellow-beings produced a
very happy change in the spirit of Rosalie. Patient,
cheerful, and hopeful, she had been before; but now,
the sight of people about her—all active, lively, energetic,
each engaged in the pursuit of some calling,
whose object was at once the benefit of his individual
self and the community—this gave strong impetus to
her enterprise, and suggested many plans of usefulness
and improvement.</p>

<p class='c005'>Considerable and thriving as was the town of Shelton,
no newspaper had as yet been published there.
Rosalie spoke of this to her husband. Could he not
create a sphere of influence and usefulness in that
way? Could he not edit an independent newspaper?</p>

<p class='c005'>It took money to set up a journal, and he had no
money, Mark answered.</p>

<p class='c005'>Could he not interest the small capitalists and business
men of the village in this enterprise?</p>

<p class='c005'>Mark replied, that to edit a paper required time,
and that his office business, though not enough to
support them comfortably, was quite enough to spoil
his leisure for any other employment.</p>

<p class='c005'>In fact, our friend was in a state of depression and
discouragement, from which it required all the faith
and hope that was in Rosalie to arouse him. She said
that she would help him, both in the law office and
with the paper. She begged him to try her—her
“good will was to it,” and she had more leisure than
she could profitably employ at present.</p>

<p class='c005'>In brief, Rosalie effected her purpose. Mark Sutherland
prevailed upon the principal men of the village
to unite in establishing a free paper; and, as a natural
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>result, they appointed Mr. Sutherland the editor.
Rosalie rendered efficient though unseen aid. Nor
did the enterprising spirit of the girl pause here.
There was no good school in Shelton. The want of
one was greatly felt. Rosalie proposed to Mark that
she should open one. Mark at first opposed the
plan—it would be too much for her. But Rosalie
found her greatest health of mind and body in her
greatest activity and usefulness. The girl’s school
was established by her single enterprise. And it
grew and prospered.</p>

<p class='c004'>Four years had passed away since Mark Sutherland
and Rosalie had taken up their residence in the village
of Shelton. In this space of time many changes had
passed over the village community and the individuals
that composed it. The Territory had been erected
into a state—new towns were incorporated—new
cities founded—old ones throve. Shelton itself had
more than doubled in population and importance.
Where there had been but three or four stores, there
were now a dozen; where there had been but two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>churches, there were now five. A handsome courthouse
stood on the site of the old log tenement,
whence the law, if not justice, had once issued its
decisions; an excellent market-place, well attended,
added much to the comfort of the citizens; a lyceum—an
incipient library and museum, perhaps—lent its
attractions to the town; an elegant and capacious
hotel replaced the rude, clap-boarded tavern of
Colonel Garner. The country around the village had
become thickly settled, and many, many improvements,
which it were tedious to enumerate, had added
to the importance of the place.</p>

<p class='c005'>Our friends, Mark and Rosalie, had grown up with
the village. Their paper, “<cite>The True Freeman</cite>,” and
their school, had both greatly prospered. But no
one in the world, except Mark himself, knew how
much of this prosperity was owing to the cheerful
hope, the firm faith, the warm zeal, the untiring perseverance
of Rosalie. And at times he wondered at
the power of that pale, fragile creature—for she was
still very delicate and frail.</p>

<p class='c005'>His professional business had increased very rapidly.
He could not have specified any day, or any suit,
from which his success had taken its impetus—all
had been so gradual, so purely the result of application
and perseverance, rather than of accident or fortune.
He felt that here too there was an outward
influence, an external power, to which he owed much,
very much, of his persistent energy—a power living
by his side, that continually threw itself with all its
ardour and force into his purposes—into his soul—warming
and strengthening him for effort, for endurance.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>His success was wonderful. He was already the
most popular, the busiest, as he was also considered
the most able lawyer in the West. Though but
twenty-five years of age, he was no longer only by
courtesy “Judge”—he was the presiding Judge of the
court, by the appointment of the Executive. He had
been elected to the State Senate; he had been named
as a candidate for Governor. And he felt and knew
that from the quiet, fair, and fragile being at his side,
he drew continual strength, and light, and warmth;
that, in addition to his own, he absorbed <em>her</em> life—her
life, that she gave freely to her love. Her form was
frailer, her face wanner, but more beautiful, more
impressive than ever—for her eyes were brilliant and
eloquent with enthusiasm, and her lips, “touched with
fire.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not only for you—not only for you—but for
<em>humanity</em>, dearest Mark, I wish you to attain power
and place. You will attain them, and——<em>I shall not
die till then</em>!” she would mentally add.</p>

<p class='c005'>At the end of the fourth year of their residence in
Shelton, Rosalie having attained her majority, it became
necessary for Mark Sutherland to go to Mississippi—to
Cashmere—on the part of his wife, for the
purpose of making a final settlement with her guardian,
Clement Sutherland, and taking possession of her
splendid fortune. He wished very much that Rosalie
should accompany him to the South; but as the
necessity of her personal attendance might be dispensed
with, and as at home the interests of their
household, their school, and the paper, seemed to
require the presence of one of them, it was decided
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>that Mark Sutherland should depart on his journey
alone.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was on a cool, pleasant day of September that
Judge Sutherland set out on his journey for the South.
Rosalie had accompanied him on board the boat, to
remain as long as she might before the steamer should
leave the wharf. It was their first separation since
their marriage, and upon that account alone, perhaps,
they felt it the more sensibly; and as the boat was
getting up her steam, Mark Sutherland blessed and
dismissed his wife. He felt—how wan, how fragile,
how spiritual was her appearance; he almost felt that
at any moment she might be wafted from his possession,
from his sight, for ever. The idea transfixed
him with a sharp agony, but only for a little while.</p>

<p class='c005'>The boat was on her way, and his thoughts turned
from her he was leaving behind to those he was
hastening to meet. This way, too, was full of anxiety.
Nearly a year had passed since he had heard from
any of his friends in Mississippi. Although he had
written to his mother regularly, he had received no
letter from her for several months, and the vague
reports from Silentshades were not satisfactory. Six
weeks had intervened since his wife had attained her
majority, and they had advised Mr. Clement Sutherland
to be prepared to give an account of and yield up the
property left in his care for so many years; yet no
answer had been vouchsafed. Rumour also spoke of
Clement Sutherland as a suspected, if not a ruined
man. Full of anxiety as to the truth of these injurious
rumours and the causes of this ominous silence, Mark
Sutherland paced the deck of the steamer as it pursued
its course down the river.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>It was on the afternoon of the sixth day of his
voyage, that the boat stopped at the wharf of the
small hamlet of C——, and Mark Sutherland debarked,
and hired a horse to take him to Cashmere. He left
his portmanteau in the care of the landlord of the
little tavern, and set out on his ride. Leaving the
low banks of the river to the westward behind him,
he rode on towards the interior of the State, ascended
a line of hills, and descending the other side, entered
once more the “Beautiful Valley of the Pearl.” Here
then he stood once more upon the scene of his youth’s
tragedy! With the profoundest interest he looked
around. But all was, or seemed to be, changed! Had
it really ever been so beautiful as it had once seemed
to him, and had age and decay passed over it? Or
had its beauty been only the glamour thrown over
the scene by youth, and love, and hope? It might
have been his changed and purified vision; for much
of imagination, enthusiasm, ideality, had passed away
with the morning of Mark’s life, even as the silvery
mist of sunrise passes away before the full, broad
day.</p>

<p class='c005'>It might have been the waning season, for it was
now late in a dry and burning September; but the
beauty and glory had departed from the vale. The
luxuriant green freshness of summer had departed,
and the brilliant and gorgeous magnificence of autumn
had not come. All the vegetation—forests, and shrubberies,
and grasses—was dry and parched in the sun,
and the very earth beneath seemed <em>calcined</em> by the dry
and burning heat. The springs, ponds, and watercourses
were low, muddy, and nearly exhausted; and
over all the sun-burned, feverish earth, hung a still,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>coppery, parching sky. You scarcely could tell which
was driest and hottest—the burning sky above, or the
burning earth below.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was, as an old field negro said, “like an oven-lid
on an oven.” The Pearl itself was now a narrow,
shrunken, sluggish stream, creeping between high
banks of red and pulverized earth, that was always
sliding in and discolouring and thickening the stream
of water.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mark Sutherland rode down to the edge of the river,
to the ferry house—once a neat and well-kept little
building, now fallen into neglect and dilapidation.</p>

<p class='c005'>The white-haired negro ferryman was a servant of
Clement Sutherland’s, and an old acquaintance of
Mark’s. He met his “young master” with a sort of
subdued surprise and pleasure, and to his question as
to whether they were all well at Cashmere, answered
with a sigh that they were just as well as usual.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mark asked no other questions, and in perfect
silence the old man put his passenger over to the
Cashmere side.</p>

<p class='c005'>Here had once been a well-kept wharf, but now it
was much worn and out of repair. Under the shade
of a group of elms on the right had once stood a
pretty boat-house, in the form of a Chinese Pagoda;
it was now a heap of ruins. There had once been a
little fleet of boats moored under its shadow; there
remained now one large, dirty skiff, half-full of mud
and water, and floating idly on the turbid stream;
and another smaller skiff, high and dry upon the beach,
with its timbers shrunken apart, bleaching in the
sun.</p>

<p class='c005'>As Mark rode on through the grounds towards the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>house, he noticed further signs of approaching desolation.
Fences were broken or down, and out-buildings
were dilapidated or unroofed. Passing through
the orchard, he saw the trees untrimmed; some broken
down with their loads of over-ripe fruit, some blighted—a
prey to vermin—and some dying or dead, and
wrapped in shrouds of cobwebs. Entering the vineyard,
he observed the trellis-work broken and falling,
the vines trailing on the ground, and the ripe and
luscious fruit rotting on its stems. He paused near
the garden on his right, and a glance showed him that
favourite resort of his youth, once the perfection of
order and beauty, now a wilderness where thousands
of the most lovely flowers and most noxious weeds
dried and decayed together under the burning sun
of September. There the deadly nightshade grew
ranker than the rose which it crowded out of life; and
the poison oak, whose contact is death, twined in and
out among the tendrils of the honeysuckle and the
clematis.</p>

<p class='c005'>Everywhere! everywhere! all things betokened indifference
and neglect, and prophesied of ruin and
despair. While occupied with wondering what could
have been the cause of this great and grievous change,
Mark Sutherland perceived the approach of an old
negro, who touched his hat in respectful salutation,
and followed him to the foot of the Rose Terrace,
where he stood in readiness to take the horse. Mark
dismounted, and threw the reins to the groom, whom
he now recognized for an old acquaintance. He held
out his hand and spoke kindly to the old man, inquiring
after his wife and children.</p>

<p class='c005'>“All well as can be ’spected—Marse Mark! Ah,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>chile! things is changed since you was here—‘deed
dey is, honey. Tree year han’ runnin’ ole marse crap
fail—‘fore my blessed Hebbenly Master, dey did,
honey—tree year han’ runnin’. ‘Deed, den, when we-dem
had fuss-rate crap, come de tornado, an’ ruin
eberyting; and nothin’ eber been fix up right since.
An’ ‘pears like nothin’ eber gone right since. Den
ole marse he went to speculatin’, and loss heap o’
money—leastways so dey do say. Den arter a bit
come de sheriff, executionizin’ down on top o’ we-dem
poor coloured people, as hadden nothin’ ‘tal to do wid
it—an’ carries away all de best of us—all my poor
dear gals an’ boys, as I hoped to spen’ my ole days
wid, an’ good many oders. And since dat, seem like
we-dem aint had no heart to tend to nothin’—a-pinin’
arter our poor children—it kinder takes all the
strength out’n us.”</p>

<p class='c005'>With a deep sigh, Mark Sutherland turned from
the poor old man, and went up the stone steps that
led to the Rose Terrace, that was also a neglected
wilderness—but a wilderness of roses, and therefore
still beautiful. Unannounced, he went up into the
piazza; and before he could retreat, in an instant he
saw and heard the following:—A man—or perhaps I
should be expected to say, a gentleman—of very
bloated and slothful appearance, was lazily reclining
upon a bench, with his feet on the top of the balustrades,
and with his right arm around the waist of a
pretty, frightened quadroon girl, who seemed from the
fan she still held, to have been engaged in keeping
the flies off from him while he slept. She was now
gently and fearfully struggling to free herself from
his clasp, and saying, in hushed, frightened tones—</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>“O! if you please, sir, don’t! Consider. Indeed
it isn’t right. What would my dear mistress say?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mistress! my pretty Oriole! I wish she may say
anything! Let her! You <em>shall</em> kiss me!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“O master! O sir!”</p>

<p class='c005'>At this moment Mark Sutherland had entered, advanced,
and bowed very coldly, saying—“Mr. St.
Gerald Ashley, if I remember right?”</p>

<p class='c005'>The ruin of St. Gerald Ashley arose to his feet, and
answered, with something of his former ease and self-possession,</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, sir. Mr. Sutherland, you are welcome to
Cashmere again. Walk in; or would you prefer to
sit down in the cool air here for a few moments? The
house is very warm. Girl, go and let you mistress
know that Mr. Sutherland has arrived.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He added this command in a tone of authority, in
strong contrast of his tone of wooing of a moment
since.</p>

<p class='c005'>Oriole, with her eyes filled with tears, and her face
dyed with blushes, went gladly to obey.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Ashley then conducted his guest into the house.</p>

<p class='c005'>In a few minutes Oriole returned. Her mistress
was too indisposed to appear; Mr. Sutherland would
please to excuse her.</p>

<p class='c005'>Within half an hour a servant, summoned for the
purpose, showed Mr. Sutherland to his room, and supplied
him with articles necessary to the bath and
toilet.</p>

<p class='c005'>After refreshing himself, Mark rang the bell, and
requested to know if Mr. Clement Sutherland was in
the house, and when he could see him.</p>

<p class='c005'>He was answered, that Mr. Sutherland had ridden
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>to the county town, and would not return before the
next morning.</p>

<p class='c005'>And soon after he was summoned to the supper-table.
No one was present at the board beside Mr.
Ashley and Mark Sutherland, except Oriole, who
stood at the head of the table, and poured out the
coffee. With profound and melancholy interest Mark
Sutherland watched this girl. She had been a pretty
child, and now had ripened into a most beautiful
woman. A slight and elegant form, well rounded and
tapering, pliant and graceful as a willow, oval face
of the purest olive, warming into pomegranate bloom
upon the cheeks and lips; large, dark-grey, passionate
eyes, fringed with long black lashes, “sweet low
brow,” shaded with soft, black, silky ringlets, a countenance
full of slumbrous passion and emotion, with
little strength of spirit or of intellect. These formed
the complete and matchless beauty of the maiden, and
Mark Sutherland noticed—he could not help but notice,
his interest was so painfully excited—the glances
with which Mr. Ashley followed the gracefully-moving
form of Oriole.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mark Sutherland wished to inquire after the health
and welfare of his mother, with whom he had made
several attempts to open a correspondence, but from
whom he had not heard for nearly four years; but an
undefinable reluctance withheld him from naming the
subject to the degenerate man before him. Mr. Ashley
ordered more wine, and pressed it upon his companion;
but Mark Sutherland, habitually abstemious,
suffered his glass to be filled once, and then excused
himself; and Mr. Ashley filled and quaffed glass after
glass, momentarily more and more garrulous, noisy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>and familiar with Oriole—calling her to his side,
drawing her towards him, pinching her cheek and
pulling her ears with maudlin freedom; while the
poor girl, blushing with shame and confusion, and
weeping with grief and terror, sought in vain to
escape.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mark Sutherland, deeply offended with the scene,
would gladly have withdrawn, but that he felt his
presence to be some protection to the poor girl; he
would gladly have interfered for her succour, but that
he knew such interference, far from saving her, would
hurry on her destruction. It is hard to be wise and
prudent when the blood is boiling; and it is uncertain
how long he would have remained so, had not a
bell sounded in a distant part of the house, and
Oriole, taking advantage of the circumstance, exclaimed,
“It is my mistress,” and made her escape.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Ashley poured out and quaffed glass after glass
of wine, until his ranting mood was merging into a
stupid one; and Mark Sutherland seized the first opportunity
to rise and leave the table, and pass into the
drawing-room.</p>

<p class='c005'>That elegant drawing-room which you may recollect
communicated with Miss Sutherland’s beautiful
boudoir—how changed since he saw it last! Desolation
was creeping even into the sanctuary of the
house. He had scarcely time to note this by the
sickly light of the moon through the open shutters,
when a loud, familiar voice in the hall arrested his
attention—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Where is he? In the drawing-room? And no
light there? Get a candle, directly, you scoundrel!
and light me in there! I shall break my shins
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>over these empty baskets and upset stools—do you
hear?”</p>

<p class='c005'>And soon after entered a slovenly man-servant
bringing a guttering tallow candle, stuck in a mildewed
silver candlestick, which he sat upon a dusty
and spotted marble pier-table. He was followed
closely by Mr. Billy Bolling, who, with outstretched
arms, and almost shouting his welcome, ran to Mark,
and clasped him around the body, exclaiming, sobbingly—</p>

<p class='c005'>“My dear—dear—bo-oy! I’m so glad to see you!
And how are you? And how did you leave little
Rose? And when did you get here? And nobody
to welcome you, but that brandy-swilling beast in
there!——Begone, you black villain, you! Who gave
<em>you</em> leave to stand there eavesdropping, eh?——That’s
a field nigger, Mark! Every decent house
servant, man and maid, that we had in the world, has
fallen under the hammer long ago—all, except Oriole,
whom that fellow yonder bought in for his own purposes.
Ah! Mark, times are changed, my boy, since
you were here! Heigh-ho! ‘<i><span lang="la">Sic transit gloria mundi</span></i>,’”
said Mr. Bolling, sinking into a threadbare velvet
chair, and wiping his rosy face—as fat, fair, and rosy
as ever.</p>

<p class='c005'>“<em>You</em> are not changed, uncle, except that you appear
to be in even finer health than ever.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“<em>Me!</em> Why, I’m dying of mortification and grief!
<em>I am.</em> I have got an organic disease of the heart.
<em>Yes, of the heart.</em> The string the most strained the
soonest snaps! Heigh-ho!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why, I declare, Uncle Billy, I never in all my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>life saw a man in such perfect health. You are fatter
and rosier than ever!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Fatter and rosier! Lord help your perspicasity!
It’s—it’s <em>dropsy</em>, and—and—<em>fever!</em> That’s what it is—this
fat and rosy.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Reassure yourself, Uncle Billy, and tell me how it
fares with all our friends.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“All going to the dogs—all going to the dogs—except
them that are going to the demon!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nay, Uncle Billy, I hope not—any more than you
are going into a consumption. How are they all at
Silentshades? How is my dear mother?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Silentshades! Mother! Heigh! didn’t you know
they had sold Silentshades long ago, and moved to
Texas?” exclaimed Uncle Billy, with a look of unbounded
astonishment.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I knew nothing about it. This is the first word
I have heard of it! What on earth could have
tempted my mother to sell her home and move away
from all her friends?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What could have tempted her?—what could have
tempted her?” repeated Uncle Billy, mockingly, shutting
his eyes, pinching his lips, and bobbing up his
nose and chin, with petulance and contempt. “What
could have tempted her to <em>marry Doctor Wells, at her
age</em>?—a woman of forty, whose matrimonial feelings
should all be quiet? What could have tempted her
to do <em>that</em>?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I suppose my mother was lonesome.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh! lonesome be hanged! Wasn’t <em>I</em> there—her
natural born brother—to keep her company? I don’t
brag—but you know what company <em>I am</em>, nephew.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes,” said Mark, suppressing a smile.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>“Well, I was there to take care of her, and protect
her, and keep her company, and cowhide her niggers—although
that last is very laborious exertion, and
always put me in a profuse perspiration, and gives me
a palpitation of the heart—the thoughtless creatures,
to put me to the trouble of fatiguing myself so. And
now, if you want to know what <em>tempted</em> your mother
to sell her home and leave all her friends, I’ll just tell
you—vanity.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Vanity!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, <em>vanity</em>—the wish to be thought generous, and
disinterested, and <em>confiding</em>,” sneered Uncle Billy.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mark Sutherland reddened.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My dearest mother was all that in reality, without
wishing to be <em>thought</em> so!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I tell you ’twas <em>vanity</em>—<em>vanity</em> that tempted her to
sell her home—<em>vanity</em> that tempted her to marry—<em>vanity</em>
that tempted her first to listen to a suitor—<em>a
woman of her age</em>! But I do think women are the
most incorrigible—the most provoking—the most
hopeless—and of all women, middle-aged widows are
the most <em>desperate</em> fools!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Uncle Billy, I suppose, as an old bachelor, you have
a license to rail at women in general, and, as an elder
brother, you have liberty to be unjust to your sister.
My mother was a handsome woman, in her prime, and
it appears to me not unnatural that she should have
married. But if you thought otherwise, you should
have told her so.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“For what good? A cat <em>may</em> release a mouse
from its claws; a rattle-snake a charmed bird from
its jaws; the grave give up its victim; but never cat
held mouse, or snake bird, or grave victim with such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>a death-grip as a middle-aged widow holds her last
lover!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Just now you told me that Dr. Wells tempted my
mother into this marriage—now, you lay the responsibility
upon <em>her</em>. That is like you, old, impartial
justice, Mr. ‘Bothsides.’”</p>

<p class='c005'>“All true. They tempted each other—she, him,
with her handsome property! he, her, with his handsome
person! He was bent on having her plantation!—she,
on having him. And so they soldered an engagement
that Satan himself, with his sledge hammer,
could not have shivered. I’ll tell you all about it,
Mark! I kept a sharp look-out on that chap when
he first came prowling about Silentshades. I was
tempted to shoot him by mistake, for a catamount.
But <em>I</em> twigged him! Very little of that palavering
courtship, that <em>I</em> didn’t hear! Sure as ever they’d be
on the piazza, <em>I’d</em> be in the parlour under the window,
listening.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But what did you think of yourself, Mr. Bolling,
for your eavesdropping?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Thought I was doing my duty by my sister, to
circumvent a gay deceiver!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mark frowned.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, now you don’t know how old pill-box and
blister-plaster could court! You should have heard
him talk about that ‘regal brow’—‘that, <em>that</em> face!’
(as if there was no word good enough to describe it)—and
‘those holy eyes’—and ‘my darling, <em>oh</em>, my darling’—and
‘my lovely Helen’—and ‘it is too much, <em>too</em>
much to crave of Heaven’ (her love you know he
meant)—and ‘oh, my dearest’—and ‘this little hand’—and
all the rest of the lying balderdash, which I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>suppose was mighty sweet to a woman who had not
heard such words for twenty years.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And how do you know it was not perfectly sincere?”
exclaimed Mark, indignantly rising and walking
away.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What, at forty?” coolly inquired Uncle Billy,
getting up and walking about, and fanning himself,
and sitting down again.</p>

<p class='c005'>But Mr. Sutherland was much too deeply interested
in his mother’s fate to keep silence. He returned, and
resumed his seat, and inquired—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Has my mother’s marriage turned out happy?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t know—can’t say, I’m sure!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You have not told me yet why she sold her
home.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dr. Wells tempted her to do it for his sake. This
was the way of it: Lord bless your soul, he was too
old and cunning to stop courting her after the honeymoon,
or at least until he had got his hands on the
property; on the contrary, they sat on the bench of
the piazza against the parlour window blinds, and
<em>courted</em> more than ever! And I laid on the lounge
under the same window in the parlour, and <em>listened</em>
more than ever. And then he cooed to her, and called
her ‘My boon,’ ‘My blessing,’ and ‘My bride;’ and
told her what a noble woman she was—how full of
sensibility, benevolence, and disinterestedness—how
full of honour, truth, and courage.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, sir, it was truth! I can easily understand
how much truth should have burst impulsively from
the lips of any one intimately associated with my dear
mother!” exclaimed Mark, impatiently.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>Uncle Billy shut his eyes, and bobbed up his chin
contemptuously, and then resumed:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Truth, was it? Well, you shall hear the rest of
the truth. By-and-by he began to take the tone of a
wise, affectionate guide and husband—which I have
always noticed is very charming to good women,
especially when it is mixed up with a little appreciative
admiration—and he told her again what a high-principled,
noble woman she was, and how she had
only to get rid of <em>one</em> foible—<em>one</em> little weakness—and
she would be a <em>glorious</em> woman—a perfect woman!
And she pressed to know what it was, and she was
willing to get rid of <em>any</em> fault he disapproved. ‘Oh,’
he told her, ‘it was a want of <em>trustfulness</em>—a want of
that <em>confiding spirit so beautiful in woman</em>—it was no
fault; only but for that one small foible she would be
such a glorious woman!’ Well, Mark, to convince
him that she could exercise a confiding spirit, and so
become ‘a glorious woman’ all out, she gives him the
full possession and perfect control of all her property,
real and personal; and the upshot of it all is, that Dr.
Wells has sold Silentshades, and they have emigrated
to Texas!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Was my mother willing to go?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t know, Mark. After parting with Silentshades,
they remained here at Cashmere about three
months before getting off to Texas; and I thought in
that three months your mother altered more than any
one I had ever seen.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Poor, dear mother!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“There was another thing that gave her trouble.
The Doctor certainly <em>did</em> neglect her; and then he
took a great fancy to purchase a beautiful maid-servant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>from Clement Sutherland—I dare say you remember
the girl—she was Mrs. Ashley’s own maid,
Oriole.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, I know”—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mrs. Ashley—India—wished to part with her, too;
and I dare say the sale would have been effected, only
there was an execution, and Oriole, with half-a-dozen
of the likeliest of the house servants, both men and
maids, were seized, and put up at auction. Well,
when Oriole was placed upon the block, there was
pretty high bidding, I assure you. The three principal
bidders were a New Orleans trader—who seemed
determined to have the girl at any price—and Dr.
Wells, and Mr. Ashley. But Dr. Wells and Mr. Ashley
outbid the trader, and had the field all to themselves;
and the contest ran very high between them. I wish
you could have seen those two men bidding against
each other for that girl! They became excited—angry—their
eyes grew blood-shot—they glanced at
each other like tigers—their glances flashed fire!
They ran the price up to a ridiculous pitch. Finally,
Dr. Wells, frowning, sat down. Mr. Ashley was the
purchaser. ‘Thank Heaven,’ said your mother, when
she heard the issue. Mrs. Ashley curled her lip in
proud silence!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mark Sutherland dropped his head upon his hands,
and groaned. A pause ensued, which after some time
was broken by Mr. Sutherland.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You mentioned an execution on the premises—is
it possible my uncle was in debt beyond his means
of cash payment?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Umph! I don’t think any one in the State would
consider it worth while to ask the question <em>now</em>.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>“I do not understand how his colossal fortune could
have so sunken.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ah, well! now I’ll tell you his fortune was not so
colossal after all. To be sure, he owned several
thousand acres of land; but reflect that nine-tenths of
that was pine barrens and cypress swamps, producing
nothing and costing considerable in taxes; and he
owned several hundred negroes; but remember that
one-third of them were old people, and one-third of
them children, who had to be supported out of the
labour of the others; and he owned this very magnificent
seat of Cashmere; but consider how much of his
capital was invested in the building, laying out and
adorning of this house and grounds, and how much
in debt it left him, and you will come to a fairer conclusion
in your estimate of your uncle’s fortune. And
then this great commercial crash, that has ruined so
many people, has affected him deeply. He lost one hundred
thousand dollars by the villany of Claxton &#38; Co.,
manufacturers, and nearly as much more by the failure
of Fleece and Brother, importers, Liverpool. And
what was worse than all, he made a desperate attempt
to retrieve his fortunes by speculation, and failed,
with a stupendous loss. It was like a gambler’s last
stake, and he lost it—and now he is ready to blow his
own brains out! Lord grant that your wife’s fortune
may be safe, Mark, which I doubt.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh! certainly; I have not the slightest misgiving
of it. It was real estate, and could not have been
staked in any way, you know.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Bolling shook his head.</p>

<p class='c005'>Unheedful of that wise gesture, Mr. Sutherland
asked, “And how does my cousin India bear this?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>“I don’t know—I don’t think she cares about it.
Mark, perhaps I oughtn’t to tell you, but I don’t
think she cares for <em>anything</em>, or has ever cared for
anything, since you and she broke off, nearly seven
years ago. She never cared a cent for the man she
married”—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hush! you must not say that!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But I <em>will</em> say it, because it’s the solemn truth.
She never cared a sous, cent, marquee, for him, though
he loved the very ground she walked on. If ever you
saw a man infatuated with a woman, St. Gerald was
with India; his eyes followed her fondly wherever she
moved. Yes, a year after they were married, I saw
him slily take up a glove of hers, and pet it, and talk
to it, and kiss it, and put it in his bosom, as if it had
been a live thing—the consummate idiot! And the
same day I saw him strike her down before him with a
blow!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mark Sutherland started to his feet, and gazed wildly
at the speaker, who reiterated—</p>

<p class='c005'>“<em>Yes</em>, I <em>did</em>; I saw that with my eyes!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And stood by, and permitted a man to strike a
woman!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I never interfere between man and wife. Besides,
what business had she to deceive and marry him,
while she loved another—and to meet his attentions
with aversion—and finally to be found sobbing
hysterically over a lock of black hair, when <em>his</em> was
brown? No, if he had killed her on the spot, I should
have been sorry for—<em>him</em>. He loved her truly and
well. She loathed him. I have seen her shudder all
over, if he did but press her hand, or stroke her
dainty curls. He felt her repulsion; it drove him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>mad! To sum up all, Mark, as I said before, a curse
is on the place and on the people; they are all going
to the dogs, who are not going to the d——l! But
now, tell me something about yourself. You are a
Judge of the Court, I hear?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have that honour.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, I always said you’d turn out well! d——d
if I didn’t! I shall live to see you Chief Justice of
the Supreme Court yet! And hark you, nephew; <em>I
intend to go home and live with you</em>. I feel it my duty
to encourage you. I’ll stick to you, Mark. I don’t
care what Clement Sutherland and the rest say. I’ll
stick to you, my boy. You shall never have it to say
that your old uncle fell away from you. But now, tell
me, how is your little wife? <em>Well</em>, I know, else you
would not be here, eh?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Rosalie is well, but not strong.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Never was, poor little thing. And how are the
little children, and how many of them are there, and
are they girls or boys, or both, and what are their
names?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“We have no children.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What! lost them all? Well, poor little things,
they are better off.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“We never had any children.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh-h-h! Whew-w-w!” whistled Mr. Bolling,
rather disconcerted; then resuming, he said—“well,
neither have the Ashleys. That’s strange! What
the d——l’s that hubbub in the dining-room? Ugh!
It’s the niggers toting that animal up to bed! <em>He</em>,
who seven years ago was called the brightest rising
star on the political horizon! Now look at him! That
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>is India’s fault! What tremendous power women
have for <em>evil</em>!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And for <em>good</em>!” said Mark Sutherland, as his
thoughts flew to his guardian angel, Rosalie.</p>

<p class='c005'>Wearied with his journey, and longing for the solitude
that would leave him free to reflect upon all that
he had just heard, Mark Sutherland expressed a wish
to retire. Mr. Bolling rang for the night lamps, and
they parted for the night.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Early the next morning Mark Sutherland descended
to the drawing-room. No one was there
except Oriole, who had just stepped from her mistress’s
boudoir, and was crossing the room, on her
way to some other part of the house. Once more
Mark Sutherland was mournfully affected by the marvellous,
the fatal beauty of the poor girl. As she
met and was passing him, with eyes cast down, cheeks
painfully flushed, and heart beating, as it had too well
learned to beat with fear at the look of man, his heart
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>was moved with deep pity. He had known her from
her infancy; he held out his hand, and spoke to her,
saying—“How do you do, Oriole? You have not
spoken to me since my arrival.” But without touching
his hand, or even venturing a glance at his face,
the maiden dropped a quick courtesy as she passed,
and hurried on her errand.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Poor, hunted, trembling deer!” said Mark: “she
cannot even trust a friend. Is it possible to save
her?”</p>

<p class='c005'>His thoughts dwelt with painful but vain intensity
upon the hapless girl, and it was many minutes before
the old familiar scene around him—suggestive as it
was of the most joyous as well as the most painful
passages in his past life—could recall him to himself.</p>

<p class='c005'>He gazed around. The sliding doors and the
flowing curtains that divided the boudoir from the
saloon, were drawn entirely back, revealing the whole
apartment. Yes; here was the same saloon, the temple
of joyous reunions, and the same boudoir, the shrine
of beauty, love, and happiness. The same, yet how
changed from all the pristine splendour of the past!
Then all was order, beauty, freshness, and enjoyment.
Now all was indifference, neglect, decay, and desolation.
Even there, in the sacred boudoir of India—the
latest sanctuary of elegance and luxury—rust and
must, mildew and canker, had crept over all. There
the sumptuous hangings of purple and gold, that made
the bower seem like some gorgeous oriental sunset
scene, were now faded and tarnished—the royal purple
turned to a dull, streaked brown and drab—the gold
cankered with green verdigris. The cheval mirrors
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>were specked thickly with mildew, and obscured with
fly-stains; the marble tables stained and smirched;
and, for the fragrance of fresh flowers, a close, damp,
stifling smell of must pervaded the apartment. All
was cheerless, hopeless, desolate.</p>

<p class='c005'>His melancholy thoughts were interrupted by the
entrance of another figure. It was India. And prepared
as he had been to meet a great change in the
“Pearl of Pearl River,” he scarcely recognised her.
The superficial is ever the first to strike us. He
noticed that the gorgeous and flowing drapery which
had once graced her form, was now replaced by a
plain black dress. The rich, warm, olive bloom of
her complexion had given place to the paleness of
ivory. Naught remained of her glorious beauty but
the luxuriant amber-hued ringlets and the large, dark,
mournful, soul-thrilling eyes. More of <em>real</em> self-possession
she exhibited now than she had ever shown in
former times. She advanced towards Mark, holding
out her hand, and welcomed him with these words:</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am happy to see you again at Cashmere—after
so many years—my dear cousin—why could we not
be friends?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Her voice faltered slightly; and when she paused,
Mr. Sutherland cordially grasped her outstretched
hands, and said, while he pressed them—</p>

<p class='c005'>“We <em>are</em> friends, my dearest India; at least, I can
speak for myself and for one who loves you not less
than I do—my wife Rosalie.”</p>

<p class='c005'>With a spasmodic catch India snatched away her
hands; and, quivering through every nerve, sat down,
and veiled her face with her hands, and,</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>“It is a trying world!”—burst from her quivering
lips.</p>

<p class='c005'>Raising his eyebrows in painful surprise, Mark
Sutherland gazed earnestly at her for an instant, and
then turned away his eyes, waiting reverently for her
self-recovery. Soon she looked up, and, faintly
smiling, said—</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have had much, oh! very much, indeed, to try
me of late, my cousin. Everything is going to ruin
with us—everything, everything.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I trust not. Your father is embarrassed, but with
the advice and assistance of his friends, all, I hope,
will be brought to a happy issue.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ah, no! but it is not of our desperate affairs I
wished to speak. Tell me of your own. You have
been successful in life?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, I have been successful, thanks, under Divine
Providence, to the constant sympathy and co-operation
of my faithful Rosalie.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Again India hastily raised her hands, to screen the
spasm of pain that traversed her countenance; and—“Why
will he stab me with that name?” she thought;
but she answered calmly—“Rosalie is an amiable
woman; how is she?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, and very busy.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And your family?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“We have no family; we are all the world to each
other.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Tell me how you have got on since I saw you
last.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Sutherland began, and told her the principal
circumstances of his life since their last parting-dwelling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>frequently upon his Rosalie’s hope and faith,
and persevering energy.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And so Rosalie has been the angel of his life,” she
muttered inaudibly between her white lips.</p>

<p class='c005'>A pause ensued, which was broken at last by India.</p>

<p class='c005'>“All is sadly changed here; my father has been
very unfortunate, and Mr. Ashley——I cannot comprehend
it! I see ruin gathering darkly around us
all, without the power—yes, and without the will—to
avert it, any more than I could avert an earthquake,
whose premonitory jars were shaking us!” she said,
in a despairing tone.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mark Sutherland made no comment. What could
he have said to console her that would not have been
false? He thought that not so would Rosalie have
met misfortune—with inert despair. And then he
remembered that much of this impending ruin the
beautiful India had drawn upon her own head, and
the heads of those who loved her, but whom, alas!
she loved not. He felt relieved when, at this point, a
summons to the breakfast-room terminated the interview.</p>

<p class='c005'>At the breakfast table appeared India, Mark Sutherland,
St. Gerald Ashley, and Mr. Bolling. Oriole served
tea and coffee from a side-table. Clement Sutherland
had not come home. Mr. Ashley’s face was bloated,
and his eyes blood-shot—the effects of the preceding
evening’s excess were but too plain. He sat silent
and morose, and ate but little. India maintained a
cold, severe aspect, never speaking to or looking at
him. Mark Sutherland felt himself <i><span lang="fr">de trop</span></i> and uncomfortable,
but for Uncle Billy, who kept up an incessant
monologue, asking a score of questions about the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>north-west, and volunteering many comments. Mr.
Sutherland was rejoiced when the gloomy meal was
over, and earnestly wished that the master of the
house might soon return, and his business and his
visit be concluded at once. He expressed this wish
to Mr. Bolling, who hastened to reply—</p>

<p class='c005'>“And so do I, nephew! and so do I! For this is
the case every day. Each night that fellow goes to
bed tipsy, and each morning appears at the breakfast
table in a state of bloated torpor! Yes, <em>Lord knows</em> do
I wish that Clem. Sutherland would come, and we
could finish our business and leave; for you know I’m
going home with <em>you</em>, Mark. I intend to stick to <em>you</em>.
I admire your principles—always <em>did</em>—<em>I’m</em> your
man.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The day advanced, and still Clement Sutherland
did not make his appearance. The late dinner was
served, and passed as gloomily as the breakfast, and
still he came not. The house was growing intolerable
to Mark, who summoned one of the servants,
and inquired where he should be likely to find his
master; and was informed that he might be found at
the Planters’ Best, where he usually stopped when
business took him to the village. Mr. Sutherland then
ordered his horse, and, while waiting for him to be
saddled and brought to the door, went and took leave
of Mr. Bolling, leaving his compliments and adieus to
Mrs. Ashley, who had retired to her room to take her
afternoon rest. Then he mounted his horse, and
took the road to the village, intending, if possible, to
have an interview and a settlement with his uncle,
and to make his head-quarters at the village inn, as
long as he should be obliged to remain.</p>

      <div class='line'>“Oh! cursed lust of gold! how for thy sake</div>
      <div class='line'>The fool throws up his interests in both worlds!</div>
      <div class='line'>First lost in this—then damned in that to come.”—<em>Blair.</em></div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>In the meanwhile, the object of his solicitude, Clement
Sutherland, sat in a private parlour of the
Planters’ Hotel, in the village of C——, <em>afraid to
return home</em>, with wild thoughts of flight darting
through his oppressed, distracted head! A victim
to the lust of gold, he had served the devil too well
to be deserted of him at the last hour. And now he
sat, with his prematurely whitened head bowed upon
his cramped and shrivelled hands, bitterly trying to
recall the wiles and review the crooked paths by which
the fiend had led him.</p>

<p class='c005'>In youth, his besetting sin had been a reasonable
wish of independence, and he called it thrift; and it
seemed to justify every kind of parsimony and selfishness.
In maturity it became a craving desire for
wealth, and he named it prudent foresight, wise provision
for the future, and it appeared to excuse every
sort of exaction from health, life, and limb, of his
labourers, or “uttermost farthing” from his debtors.
In midlife it grew an absorbing passion, and he termed
it parental devotion, and it seemed to palliate every
species of injustice, cruelty, and dishonesty. In his
age it reached its full development, as a monomania,
which he no longer sought to sanctify by any holy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>name, when it led him into <em>crime</em>—into the crime of
<em>forgery</em>!</p>

<p class='c005'>Some months before, a most promising opportunity
offered of making a great speculation by the investment
of a considerable sum of money. But how to
raise this sum? He had neither cash nor credit; and
all his estate in which he had retained more than a
life interest, was mortgaged to nearly its full value.
There was one means of raising the funds suggested
to his mind, but his soul shrank from it. He could
anticipate his ward’s majority by a few months, and
borrow her signature only for a power of attorney and
a deed of mortgage—that was all. And the money
could be raised on her real estate, and the sum invested,
and the profits secured. And then the mortgage
could be released and destroyed before the (he
hesitated to give the act its proper name, even in his
thought) forgery could be discovered and exposed.
So the tempter persuaded him.</p>

<p class='c005'>He had never trained his moral strength by resisting
slight temptations; and now that the temptation
was very great, he fell before it. Scarcely daring
to think on what he was about to do, he left the
neighbourhood of Cashmere for two weeks, and on
his return, laid before his correspondent, the usurer
at C——, a power of attorney and a deed of mortgage,
seemingly duly signed, witnessed and attested.
Upon these the requisite funds were borrowed, embarked
in the speculation, and lost!</p>

<p class='c005'>And now the dread day of account had come, and
he sat overwhelmed, crushed, unable to fly, afraid to
go home, yet fitfully and by turns impelled to each
course. It was while he sat there, by turns stupified
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>and distracted, that the door was opened by a waiter,
who announced—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Judge Sutherland!”</p>

<p class='c005'>And retired, as Mark walked in.</p>

<p class='c005'>Clement Sutherland started to his feet, pale and
wild-looking, and gazed, without speaking, at his
nephew.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Sir, you are ill!” exclaimed the latter, anxiously,
stepping up to him.</p>

<p class='c005'>Muttering some inaudible words between his white
lips, the old man sunk down, collapsed, into his chair.
Mark hastily stepped to the bell-rope, to ring for
wine. But the guilty man, in the confusion of his
trouble, misunderstood the intention, and stretching
out his trembling, almost palsied arm, bade him “Stop,
for Christ’s sake!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mark returned, with looks of interest.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I did not mean to—to <em>wrong</em> her! God knows I
did not!” said the old man, in a quivering tone.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Wrong whom?” added Mark, regarding him with
much surprise and anxiety; “sir, sir, you are really
ill, and I must summon some assistance.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, no! you are mistaken. Bring no witnesses.
It is—it is—a family affair. Now, I suppose, you will
have your revenge!” exclaimed Clement Sutherland,
with a frightened, chattering smile.</p>

<p class='c005'>Without more ado, Mark hastened to the door, with
the purpose of sending for a physician. But the old
man sprang, tottered after him, and clasped him around,
staggered back, exclaiming—“You shall not! I’ll have
no witnesses. Oh! you’re a lawyer!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mark Sutherland disengaged himself, sat his uncle
down in a chair, and stood for a moment undecided how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>to proceed—vague suspicions crossing his mind for
the first time, as he heard his wild words, and recollected
Mr. Bolling’s ominous doubts.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, look!” exclaimed the distracted culprit, who
had quite lost his self-possession, “look! and consider
what you will do! It will be a fine revenge, for old
and new, to cast the white-haired man into a State-prison,
won’t it? Now, hark ye! No dishonour can
crush me that will not touch you! Remember that!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mark Sutherland went to a sideboard, poured out a
glass of water, and brought it to his uncle, who took
it in his trembling hand and quaffed it off, and returned
the empty glass, all mechanically, and without a word
of acknowledgment. Mark Sutherland put down the
glass, and then returned and took his seat beside the
guilty man, saying calmly, and with some reserve—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now, sir, it were best for all parties concerned, that
you should put me in possession of the facts of this
case.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And criminate myself! Ha! that’s a lawyer’s trick,
to lead me into such a folly. But I’m cool, I’m collected,
I’m not going to do it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Sir, you have already criminated yourself.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ha! you wish to trap me into doing so, so that you
can take your revenge. It would be a tremendous
revenge, would it not?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Sir, you know well that no such mean spirit of
vengeance will influence my action in this matter.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ha! well, it will be because it cannot. You can’t
prosecute me—you can’t appear against me—because
you can’t disgrace me without dishonouring yourself.
It would not do, you think, to have it said that Judge
Sutherland’s uncle was a felon.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>“And why should not ‘Judge Sutherland’s’ uncle,
or Judge Anyone’s uncle, be called a felon, if he <em>is</em> a
felon, as well as the poorest man’s uncle alive? Is it
because the former has more power, more means, more
friends, fewer wants, fewer temptations, than the latter?
I think not. No, sir! family pride will no more restrain
my action, than revenge will impel it. Family considerations,
personal pride, never <em>have</em> influenced my
conduct, and never <em>will</em> do so. No, sir; I conform
my life to a purer rule of action. In every question
there is a right and a wrong. I obey the right. Had
I a brother or a son guilty of felony, and it became
my duty to bear witness against either, I should do it,
though my testimony consigned the culprit to death.
No, sir; if we refrain from prosecution, it will be for
a reason much holier than pride. It will be from a
motive that would also actuate us in sparing the veriest
forsaken wretch alive!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Clement Sutherland had sat with his elbows on the
table, and his head bowed in his hands, his grey hair
dishevelled, and his thin, withered features whitened
and drawn in as by internal agony. But now he bursts
forth in a fit of fury, as ungovernable as it was unreasonable
and impotent. Mark Sutherland stood quietly
by, and let his rage exhaust itself. Then, when the
guilty man was calm from prostration, his nephew
spoke to him coolly, wisely, kindly—making him understand
and feel that his detection was inevitable, unless
he put him in possession of all the facts, to prepare
him to meet knowingly the exigencies of the case. It
was very difficult to influence the wretched man, who,
having parted with his own faith, was unable to rest
on the good faith of any other. And it was only after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>arguing and persuading him all the afternoon and evening,
that late at night he won from the guilty man a
full account of the circumstances.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And now, what do you purpose to do?” was his
trembling question, when he had confessed all.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I shall return home to-morrow, and take counsel
with Rosalie.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Take counsel with <em>her</em>!” exclaimed the old man,
in alarm.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Be at ease, sir. She has a voice in this matter
Nay, she <em>has</em>—it <em>must</em> be—it is <em>her</em> name that has
been used—<em>her</em> property that is lost. And if it were
not—if it were my own exclusive affair, still I should
consult her before taking any important step!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“<em>What will become of us?</em>—of India? My child!
my child! that your high head should be bowed
with shame!” cried the wretched man, in a voice of
anguish.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Reassure yourself, sir, I beg. I can answer for
Rosalie’s noble heart. You are safe from all punishment
from her. And now let us part at once. You
had better return to Cashmere, where your family
must be anxiously awaiting you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And where will you stay?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“To-night I shall go on board the steamer Victress,
which will leave for the Upper Mississippi to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Suddenly the old man lifted up his head, and showed
a countenance brightened with hope. Mr. Sutherland
stopped to hear what he had to say. He grasped the
arm of his nephew, exclaiming—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh! Mark, I have it now. I have found the
means by which family honour and Rosalie’s fortune
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>both may be saved. Rosalie need not deny her signature;
that will protect me, and save family honour.
But the signature was written before she came of age;
therefore the deeds are null and void and the usurer
cannot foreclose the mortgage, or recover his money.
So you see that I can—I mean family honour—can be
saved, and Rosalie lose nothing either.”</p>

<p class='c005'>An involuntary expression of scorn and loathing
flashed from Mark Sutherland’s fine Roman face for a
moment; and then, composing himself, he replied,
coolly—</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, sir; if you are saved, it must be at our own
proper cost and loss.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And so they parted.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Mark Sutherland went on board the Victress,
and almost immediately betook himself to the solitude
of the forsaken hurricane deck, there to walk,
and while the water breeze fanned his fevered brow,
to reflect upon the sinfulness, the danger, of an ungoverned
lust of gold—upon the crimes to which it
often leads, and upon the felony made known to him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>that evening. The orgies of a noisy party of card-players
in the saloon below occasionally broke upon
his silence; and the sweet laughter of young girls,
walking on the guards of the ladies’ cabin, was borne
upwards on the wind. But the hurricane deck was
lonely, and there he paced up and down, wrapped in
mournful thought, until the arrival of a noisy set, who,
weary of the heated saloon, sought the free, fresh air
above, and disturbed his solitude. Then he went
below, and sought his berth.</p>

<p class='c005'>Early in the morning he arose from a sleepless
couch, to find all the officers and hands on the boat
engaged in receiving last freight and passengers, while
the engine was getting up her steam to be off. Mark
Sutherland finished his morning toilet, and went out
upon the guards, just as the boat was beginning to
move from the wharf. The usual crowd of idlers,
porters, and loafers, stood upon the shore, watching
her departure. And Mark Sutherland fixed himself
in a favourable position for watching the receding
wharf of what might be called his native village, when
the figure of a fat man, in white linen jacket and
trousers, with his light hair blowing free behind his
rosy face, waving a straw hat, came running desperately
towards the wharf. The boat arrested her
motions, the plank was thrown out, and Uncle Billy
followed by a man with his trunk and portmanteau,
stepped on board. Panting and blowing, and wiping
his face, he hastened up to Mr. Sutherland, exclaiming,
“My dear boy! I liked to have missed you!
Near as possible! Wouldn’t have lost you for the
world, my dearest lad! Stick to you as long as I live,
Mark, for your dear mother, my sister’s sake! Whew!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span><em>Whew-ew!</em> what a chase I’ve had! Only heard this
morning, from Clement, that you were going by the
Victress! Running ain’t good for me. Dangerous!”
And so, talking and shaking his nephew’s hand, and
wiping his own rosy face, and blowing and panting,
Mr. Bolling at last sat down, and began to fan himself
with his broad-brimmed straw hat.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mark Sutherland received his relative’s demonstrations
of attachment as best he might; he welcomed
him, and went to the captain’s office to see if he could
secure a state-room for his enforced travelling companion;
and by the time he had successfully accomplished
his errand, the passengers were summoned
to the breakfast table, and the boat had cleared
the wharf and was well under way up the Mississippi.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was a slow voyage up the river, and on the afternoon
of the twelfth day the steamer arrived at the
wharf of Shelton. Mark Sutherland wished, if possible,
to get rid of his troublesome travelling companion
for a few hours, while he could go home
quietly, and have an uninterrupted meeting and talk
with his dear Rosalie.</p>

<p class='c005'>So, leaving all their baggage in the care of the
clerk of the boat, Mark drew Uncle Billy’s fat arm
within his own, and conducted him to Col. Garner’s
hotel, to a private parlour, containing a comfortable
lounge and easy chair. Here he ordered
a luncheon of cold ham, fowl, sardines, pickled
oysters, and next all the late newspapers the house
could muster; and having seen them all arranged
upon the table, to which the easy chair was drawn
up, and while Uncle Billy stretched his lazy length
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>upon the lounge, Mr. Sutherland turned to Mr. Bolling,
and said—</p>

<p class='c005'>“And now, Uncle Billy, can you excuse me, and
make yourself comfortable, while I run down to
Rosalie and prepare her for your arrival?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Eh? Yes; all right! Certainly! The child always
was fond of me, and it might give her too much of a
shock to meet me suddenly, after so long a separation!
Very considerate of you, Mark, certainly—very!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Is there anything else I can order for you before
I go?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Eh? No, nothing; I am much obliged to you,
nephew.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, if you should think of anything after I am
gone, you can ring for it, you know.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes—yes.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Good afternoon for the present, I will come and
fetch you at tea-time.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes; very well, I shall be ready. Hark ye, Mark!
break my arrival to your wife cautiously, do you hear?
Joy kills sometimes.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I shall be careful not to endanger Rosalie’s life,”
said Mark, smiling as he left the room.</p>

<p class='c005'>No sooner had the door closed behind his nephew,
than, with a sigh of profound satisfaction, Uncle
Billy arose and sat down in the easy chair, and drew
the table towards him. In addition to everything
else on the table, there was a tall, black bottle, which
Mr. Bolling took up, uncorked, and put to his nose
with a look of delightful anticipation. He sat it
down suddenly, with an expression of intense disgust—</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>“Tomato catsup, by all that is detestable, and
I thought it was port wine! Here, waiter!—(where
the devil is the bell-rope?) Waiter, I say!”</p>

<p class='c005'>A man in a linen apron put his head in at the
door—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Did you call, sir?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes; bring me a bottle of your best port wine.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The man withdrew, and after a while returned with
a black bottle of the villanous drugged compound
which is sold and bought as the best port wine, and
which <i><span lang="fr">bon vivants</span></i> like Mr. Bolling imbibe with perfect
faith.</p>

<p class='c005'>We will leave Uncle Billy to the enjoyment of his
beloved creature comforts, and follow Mark Sutherland
to his “sweet home.”</p>

<p class='c004'>On the outskirts of the town, embosomed in a grove
of trees, stood Rose Cottage, the pleasant home of the
Sutherlands. It was named partly from Rosalie, and
partly from her favourite flower—the rose—of which
every variety had been collected and cultivated to
adorn her house and garden. The house itself was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>simple and plain in its structure—just an oblong two-story
frame building, painted white, with green
Venetian blinds, and having four rooms on each floor,
with a wide passage running through the centre from
front to back, and with an upper and lower piazza
running all around the house.</p>

<p class='c005'>The grounds were unpretending, too—behind the
house a kitchen garden and young orchard; in front
and at the sides a spacious yard, where single great
forest trees were left standing, with rural seats fixed
under their shade. In that rich and fertile soil the
favourite rose flourished luxuriantly. Rose-trees
adorned the yard, rose-bushes hedged the parterres,
rose vines shaded the arbours and climbed the pillars
of the piazza and gracefully festooned the eaves, and
the fragrance of roses filled the air. What gave a
tenderer interest to these beautiful roses was, that they
were all love-offerings from the young girls and children
to their beautiful and beloved teacher.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mark Sutherland approached this sweet home.
Every care and sorrow dropped from his spirit as he
opened the little wicket-gate that separated his garden
of Eden from the wilderness. He walked on through
the shaded yard to the house, and went up to the
piazza, and through the front door into the hall, or
passage. Here two doors, opposite each other to the
right and left, opened—one into their parlour and
dining-room, and the other into the school and classroom.
He paused a moment, and listened, with a
smile, as the low murmur of girls’ voices revealed to
him that the school was not yet dismissed.</p>

<p class='c005'>He opened the door and entered.</p>

<p class='c005'>Surely, there never was a school-room so pleasant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>as this, from which the aspect of dullness, weariness,
restraint, and irksomeness, was so completely banished,
as there certainly never was a teacher so lovely and
so beloved. It was a spacious, airy apartment, lighted
with many windows, shaded at a little distance by the
rose-wreathed pillars and eaves of the piazza. The
furniture was of bright cherry, in cheerful contrast to
the white walls and floor. Maps and pictures, of rare
beauty and appropriateness, decorated the walls, and
shells and minerals and mosses adorned the tables.</p>

<p class='c005'>The young girls and children—some engaged in
study, some in pencil-drawing or penmanship, and
some in needlework—looked cheery and very much
at their ease. They left their seats, and spoke to each
other without infringing any rule, but all was done
quietly and gracefully, as under the influence of a
beloved mistress, whom they obeyed with no forced
eye-service, and whom they would not for the world
distress or annoy.</p>

<p class='c005'>And there, at the upper end of the room, on a platform
raised but one step above the floor, on a chair,
at a table, sat the young schoolmistress—the wife of
four years’ standing—scarcely turned twenty-one, and
with the loveliest and most delicate face and form in
the world, yet by the power of her soul’s strength and
beauty keeping in willing subjection a miscellaneous
crowd of girls, of all ages, sizes, and tempers. There
she sat, with her sweet, fair face, and pale, golden,
curly hair, and white muslin wrapper—looking the
fairest girl among them all. When Mark entered, the
quiet light of joy dawned in her eyes, and she arose
and came softly down to meet him. There was a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>subdued gladness in the manner of both, as they
clasped hands.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My dearest Rose, you are so much better than
when I went away,” said Mark, looking fondly at her,
as the bloom deepened on her cheeks.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am better—I am <em>well</em>” replied Rosalie, smiling
round upon her girls, several of whom left their seats,
and came fluttering forward to welcome Mr. Sutherland
with saucy pleasure. He had a merry jest or a
loving word for each affectionate child, but soon sent
them gaily back to their places, as the hour of dismissal
had come. And Rosalie, accompanied by Mark,
went back to her seat, and called the school to order,
and gave out and led the evening hymn that closed
their exercises.</p>

<p class='c005'>When the song was finished, and the girls all gone,
Mark Sutherland turned to his young wife, and with
a smile of joy drew her to his bosom. But in a moment
a shade of anxiety clouded his face; and, still
clasping her close to his bosom, he asked—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Rose, what makes your heart throb so violently?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Rosalie raised her eyes to his face, and he noticed
that a sorrowful shade dimmed their lustre for an
instant, but vanished before the smile with which she
replied—</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am so glad to see you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But your heart knocks so forcibly?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Come in the parlour, and let’s sit down there and
talk—I have so many things to tell you, and to ask
you about,” said Rosalie, evading his remarks; and
gently withdrawing herself, she led the way into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>parlour, and wheeled up an easy chair, and begged
him to “sit down and make himself at home.”</p>

<p class='c005'>But, first, he made her recline upon the lounge
and rest, while he drew the chair up and sat by her
side.</p>

<p class='c005'>And there she lay, with her sweet, spiritual face,
white as her drapery, except where all the colour had
concentrated in a circumscribed fiery spot in either
cheek. She was breathing short, yet smiling gaily at
her own difficulty.</p>

<p class='c005'>He sat watching her, and trying to feel and to look
happy, yet thinking that after all she was not so well
as when he had left her—perceiving that he had mistaken
fever heat for healthful bloom. He sat, trying
to smile and talk cheerfully, yet with a dull, aching
prophecy in his heart. It was in vain to stifle the
rising anxiety. It found some vent in these words:</p>

<p class='c005'>“My love, you work too hard; that school is hurting
your health?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, dear Mark, believe me, it is not—it keeps
me up.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It exhausts, it prostrates you, my love—indeed, it
must be closed—that school <em>must</em> be closed!”</p>

<p class='c005'>By way of nimbly proving how strong she was, she
arose to a sitting posture, arranged her hair by running
her slender fingers through the ringlets, adjusted
her dress, and sat straight up, while she
answered—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not for the world would I close that school, dear
Mark. I have no children, and that school is my
field of almost unbounded usefulness. Those girls
are my children; and not only must I cultivate their
intellects, but in every young, receptive heart I must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>sow good seed, that will bring forth fruit long after I
am in”——</p>

<p class='c005'>She paused suddenly, in embarrassment.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What do you mean, Rosalie?” he asked, in distress.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dearest Mark,” she said, slightly evading a direct
reply, “dearest Mark, a faithful teacher, called to the
work, may not abandon her post, indeed; for oh! see
how mighty the influence of a teacher may be, and
how long it may last—the good principles instilled
into a little girl’s tender heart do not conclude their
work with her alone, but influence her children, and
her children’s children, and all who come within her
sphere and in theirs. Consider how mighty an instrument
of good is set in motion by teaching aright
one little child, and I faithfully try to teach forty. So,
dearest Mark, hinder me not; but while I live, let me
sow the good seed, that it may bring forth good fruit
when I am—I mean when all this generation shall
have passed away.”</p>

<p class='c005'>There was a pause, during which he held her hand
fondly, and seemed buried in thought.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dearest Mark, you look so careworn—have you
had much trouble in settling our business?”</p>

<p class='c005'>He raised his head, and looked at her sweet, wan
face. He could not, for his life, tell anything to
distress her then; so he answered that Mr. Clement
Sutherland was not yet prepared to give an account
of his trust, but that all would be arranged before the
close of the month.</p>

<p class='c005'>Rosalie arose, and putting her hands upon his
shoulders, pressed a kiss upon his forehead, and was
sliding away.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>“Where are you going?” asked Mark, detaining
her.</p>

<p class='c005'>“To order tea, of course,” she answered.</p>

<p class='c005'>Suddenly Mr. Sutherland remembered Uncle Billy.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Stop, Rosalie,” he said, “I have got something to
tell you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And Rosalie sat down again; and Mark, in some
painful and ludicrous embarrassment, related his
meeting with Mr. Bolling, and the manner in which
that impartial, disinterested gentleman had thrust
himself upon him for life.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And where have you left him now?” asked
Rosalie.</p>

<p class='c005'>“At Col. Garner’s, enjoying himself. Really, my
dearest Rose, I feel very much annoyed that you
should be troubled with this old man,” said Mark
Sutherland, in a tone of vexation.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Bless your kind heart, dear Mark, he will be
no trouble to me. I have not the shadow of an
objection to his coming; I think I shall rather like
to have him. Uncle Billy always was rather a
cheerful object to me—such a neat, clean, fresh,
dainty, self-satisfied, delightful old gentleman! We
can put him in the other front room up stairs, you
know!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But to be burdened with him for ever, Rose!
Just think of it! And the most provoking part
of it is, he thinks he is doing us a mighty benefit!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well! poor, homeless old gentleman! let him
think so, if it makes him happy. Never let him
feel a sense of obligation, or fancy that we are not
delighted to have him! I can speak truly for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>myself—I shall be very glad to make the old man
contented!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, yes; he says you’re very fond of him, and
begged me not to break his arrival to you too
abruptly, lest the sudden joy should be too much for
you!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Rosalie laughed outright. Her silvery laughter
was very sweet, from its rarity, and Mark found it
charming. He caught her gaily, and kissed her
cheek. Oh, that burning cheek! it sobered him
directly. He took his hat, and went to fetch Uncle
Billy.</p>

<p class='c004'>And Rosalie passed into a large, square, well-ordered
kitchen, over which presided another Billy—Mrs.
Attridge’s ex-servant, and now Rosalie’s
maid-of-all-work. And the short history of the
transfer of his services was this: Mr. and Mrs.
Attridge, having no family, grew lonely, and tired
of housekeeping in the country. So they broke
up, sold their furniture, rented out their place, and
came to Shelton, and took rooms at Garner’s Hotel.</p>

<p class='c005'>So Billy was out of a place. A great many housekeepers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>would have been glad to hire him. But
Billy, like all invaluable geniuses, had a great many
eccentricities and difficulties to be got over. He
wouldn’t live in a row of houses, or in any sort
of a house that wasn’t a handsome house, in a
large space, with trees round it. He wouldn’t
live in a family that had babies, or <em>hadn’t</em> cows and
a garden. Poultry was also indispensable, and pigs
totally inadmissible. And lastly, he wouldn’t live—no,
not in town or country, neither for love
nor money, with anybody who was not good-looking.
There—to use Billy’s own words—he set his
foot down, and no one could move him from that
position. And so it fell out that Billy would accept
no place in Shelton, but continued hanging on to
the skirts of his old master and mistress, at Garner’s
Hotel.</p>

<p class='c005'>But one day, it happened that Rosalie, after she
had dismissed her afternoon school, stood at her
nice white kitchen table kneading bread for supper,
when a shadow darkened the door, and the sound
of something dumped suddenly down upon the floor,
caused her to turn round. There stood Billy, in
his pale blue cotton jacket and trousers, and clean
linen apron and straw hat, with a great bundle at
his back, and a heavy trunk at his feet. Down he
dropped the bundle upon the trunk, and heaving a
deep sigh of relief, said—</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m been looking for you to send arter me to come
and live ’long o’ you. Why ain’t you sent afore this?
Don’t like to be a-losing so much time.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why, Billy, I had no idea you wished to come
and live with us,” returned Rose, in surprise.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>“Well, you might a-known it, then! You always
knowed I liked you and him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I thought you refused to go out to service?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I ’fused all <em>them there</em>” said Billy, chucking his
thumb contemptuously over his shoulder, pointing in
the direction of the village—“think I’m agoin’ to live
in a bake-oven, like them there red brick houses?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But you might have gone to the country.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, but you know most all on ’em were so ill-looking—I
mean the people, and for that matter the
houses too—and then they kept pigs, as made an
onpleasant fragrance, and childun, as made werry onpleasant
noises. And some places, the missus was
either ugly in her temper, or her face, or in both,
which is dreadful. And in other places the master
was always a-interfering with the dinner or the dishcloths,
in a very misbecoming manner. Some on ’em
were not nice in their ways; and what ’couragement
would it be to me to put on a clean apron every day,
with a nice stiff crease ironed down in the middle of
it, to sarve people as wa’n’t clean themselves? So the
long and the short of it is, ma’am, that I’m come to
live ’long o’ you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Now, Rosalie was so gentle-hearted that she did
not speak her thought, and say—“But we did not
send for you, Billy.” Yet, nevertheless, Billy guessed
it, for he answered as if she had spoken—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, what o’ that? Here I <em>am</em>. And here’s my
trunk and bundle. I paid a man twenty-five cents to
help me to bring them over. I reckon I can stay, if I
’gree to stay on your own terms,” said Billy, betraying
piteous anxiety nevertheless.</p>

<p class='c005'>Gentle and truthful Rosalie hastened to set his fears
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>at rest. “Indeed, Billy, we shall be delighted to have
you. You will be an invaluable acquisition to us. I
am only very much surprised that you should have
given us the preference.”</p>

<p class='c005'>A bright, glad smile broke over honest Billy’s face.
“Why, you see, ma’am, I don’t care how much work
I have to do—I does it cheerful. I don’t care how
little wages I gets—I takes it—contented. But I ain’t
got but one life to live on this yeth, and while I do
live, I <em>must</em> live in a pretty place, long o’ pretty
people. Anything else smothers of me—it stifles of
me—it gives me the—I mean it makes my wittles
disagree with me.” And, so saying, Billy shouldered
his bundle and trunk, and took them up into the loft
over the kitchen, as if he had slept there all his life,
and knew the way. And then he came down, and
took two big buckets to go to the well. And so,
without more ado, Billy was inaugurated in his new
place and duties. And a most “invaluable acquisition”
he really proved. Billy had now been living
several months with the Sutherlands.</p>

<p class='c005'>To return: Rosalie went into the kitchen, to give
directions to Billy about the supper. She found him
sitting down, stirring the batter for the pancakes.
She told him she expected a stranger to tea, and that
he must make coffee also, and dress two prairie fowls,
and broil some ham. And next she went into her
dining-room and set her table, adorning it with her
finest damask table-cloth, and best china, and placing
upon it her nicest cakes and preserves. She was so
engaged when Mr. Sutherland returned, bringing in
Uncle Billy.</p>

<p class='c005'>I cannot do anything like justice to the vociferous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>joy with which Mr. Bolling rushed upon his dear
niece, as he called Rosalie. She received him with an
affectionate welcome.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am come to stay with you as long as I possibly
can, my dear. Although a man like me has a great
many conflicting claims upon his time and presence,
of course, nevertheless I intend to stay with you as
long as possible.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Rosalie assured him that the longer he stayed the
better she should be pleased. And then, as Billy had
put supper on the table, she invited him in to that
meal. And Mr. Bolling sat down and enjoyed it with
as much gusto as if he had not partaken of a heavy
luncheon at Garner’s. When supper was over, and
Mr. Bolling had been invited by Mark to take a stroll
around the premises, Billy entered, to clear off the
table, and, pointing with his thumb over his shoulder,
he asked—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Who <em>is</em> yon fat, puffed-up fellow in the rosy face
and white jacket and trousers?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“He is my husband’s uncle, and you must speak
of him more respectfully.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That’s ’cordin’ as it may be,” said Billy, as he
moved off under the weight of the laden tea-tray.</p>

<p class='c005'>Rosalie’s benevolent heart was so gratified at having
some one else to be good to, and Mark was so pleased
to see her satisfaction, that he became quite reconciled
to the intruder.</p>

<p class='c005'>But Billy was not to be mollified. When Mr. Bolling
had been domesticated a week in the house, one
morning Billy bounced suddenly in upon Rosalie, as
she stood arranging the breakfast table, and asked—</p>

<p class='c005'>“How long is your uncle-in-law going to stay here?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>“I do not know, Billy; probably all his life.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh! he is! Well, I tell you, one of us two’s got
to leave!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Just as you please, Billy. You know, of course,
we can’t turn out a guest to gratify you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, I give you warning—that’s all!” and Billy
bounced out in high dudgeon. But presently he came
back again.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Look here, ma’am; I don’t want to be onreasonable,
but just consider what a difference it makes in
my washing and ironing. Look here! every day your
uncle-in-law puts on a spic span clean suit, all out!
every day, clean jacket, clean trousers, clean shirt,
clean what-you-call-’ems, and clean cravat, and pocket-handkerchiefs,
and clean socks. Now count. There’s
seven pieces every day, and seven days in the week;
now, how much is seven sevens? You’re a schollard.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Forty-nine!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, there’s forty-nine pieces of clothing, to say
nothing of four sheets and two bolster slips, and two
pillow slips, and fourteen towels, and table napkins, I
have extra washing and ironing for him every week.
Now I’m going to count, and see how much it all
’mounts to—ninety-two pieces! Ninety-two pieces
extra washing and ironing I have to do, all along of
your pet uncle-in-law! Now, you know I can’t stand
that! No reasonable ’oman would want me to stand
it!” said Billy, appealingly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, of course not,” said Rose, thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c005'>“So onreasonable in any uncle-in-law to act so.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You must excuse our visitor, Billy. He has been
used to the convenience of a large plantation laundry.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, I think he ought to staid there.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>“We will put out Mr. Bolling’s washing.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And put yourself to an extra ’spense, and not have
clothes half done? No, I can’t ’pose on you that way,
neither. Well, I’ll not give warning yet awhile! I’ll
see how long I can stand it!” And Billy left the
room, and took more pains to please his gentle mistress
that day than he ever did before.</p>

<p class='c005'>There was no love lost on Mr. Bolling’s side either,
and—“Insolent fellow!” and “Is he an idiot?” and
“You all spoil that fellow of yours, Mark!” fell often
from his lips, and sometimes in honest Billy’s hearing.
And one day, while the family were all gathered round
the dinner-table, Mr. Bolling said to his niece and
nephew—“My dear children, I must request you to
drop the name of Uncle Billy, and substitute Uncle
William, when you address me. There are two of
that name in this house, and if you call me Uncle
Billy, strangers might confound me in some way with
Billy Bumpkin in the kitchen there, which would not
be complimentary.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Rosalie afterwards thought that her factotum must
have heard these offensive remarks; for the next
evening, as she entered the kitchen, to order supper,
he approached her respectfully, and said—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mrs. Sutherland, ma’am, if you please, ma’am, I
would be thankful if you’d be so good as to call me
William, which is the name given me by my sponsors
in baptism, and not ‘Billy,’ for fear people might get
me jumbled up in their minds along o’ that fat, lazy
man, in white teeth and linen, which would lose me
my good character, and be very onpleasant to my
friends.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Mark Sutherland had been home eight days
before he broke to Rosalie the sad news of his uncle’s
betrayal of his trust, and her own loss of fortune.</p>

<p class='c005'>Rosalie heard it with sorrow and amazement. She
replied by not one word, but dropped her head upon
her hands, and remained silent so long that her husband
became anxious and alarmed. In truth, it was
a most bitter disappointment to the young wife—she
had looked forward to coming of age, and coming
into possession of her fortune, with so much impatience,
with such bright anticipations, not for herself,
but for her husband’s sake. It would have
placed them in so much more favourable circumstances.
It would have relaxed the tight strain of
office work from the overtasked, weary lawyer, and
left him more leisure for the study of the higher and
more attractive and more honourable branches of his
dry profession. It would have afforded him means
and leisure for engaging actively in political life, and
never was the country more in need of honest men
“to the fore.” It would have enabled him to assist
largely in the public improvements of the growing
city. Nay, what good might they not have done
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>with the large fortune that was lost? Indeed, it was
a sudden, stunning blow to Rosalie; and oh! worse
than all, was the thought of him whose guilty hand
had dealt that blow. She sat so long overwhelmed
by the shock, that her husband—Heaven forgive
him!—misunderstood her silence and stillness, and
misconstrued her noble heart. He said—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Rosalie, my love, look up! This loss of fortune,
which you take so much to heart, is not inevitable,
irrecoverable. Disclaim the signature, expose the
forgery”—</p>

<p class='c005'>She raised her head, and looked up at him, with
wonder in her mild, mournful eyes.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And what then?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Your estate cannot then be touched by the forged
mortgage.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And the man who confidingly loaned the money
on the mortgage?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Will lose forty thousand dollars.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And Clement Sutherland?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“May go to the State’s prison for ten years.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She suddenly dropped her head upon her hands,
and shuddered through all her frame, and remained
silent for another while. And then she rose up and
threw herself in his arms, and clasped him around the
neck, saying—</p>

<p class='c005'>“We must lose it, dear Mark; we must lose it! Oh!
I am so sorry for you!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My poor Rose, I knew what your decision would
be; I told the wretched man so. But, my dearest, it
is proper that I should set the matter before you in
its true light. Should you fail to expose the forged
mortgage, you will not only lose the sum of forty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>thousand dollars, which was raised on your plantation,
but, by the foreclosure of the mortgage, and the
peremptory sale of the plantation, the property will
be sacrificed at about a fourth of its real value, and
you will lose all, my poor Rosalie.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I do suppose so. Well, well; let all go—all, but
peace of mind; for, my dearest Mark, could you or I
enjoy peace of mind—could we take pleasure in our
morning ramble, or our evening fireside—could we
take comfort in anything, dearest Mark, if a deliberate
deed of ours had consigned a fellow-creature—an
old, gray-headed man—to a prison? Oh, never let it
be dreamed of, Mark.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That is a woman’s thought! Men would deem it
a stern duty to prosecute the criminal.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And do you?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I should so deem it, but for the thought that this
is the old man’s first offence, under great temptation;
that it surely will be his last; that punishment, in his
case, would not be reformatory, but ruinous; that no
one can be tempted by the impunity of his crime,
since no one but ourselves know it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>This was all that was said then. Mr. Bolling’s
entrance interrupted the conversation; and Billy soon
appeared and summoned the party to tea. And though
Rosalie presided at her supper-table that evening with
a graver face than usual, yet by the next morning she
had recovered her self-possession and cheerfulness, and
met them all at breakfast with a smile.</p>

<p class='c004'>A week after this, Mark Sutherland once more left
home for a visit to Mississippi, on business. He
went to make a final settlement with Clement Sutherland.</p>

<p class='c005'>The miserable old man had fallen, almost into a
state of idiotcy. He gave up all the title deeds
and various documents relating to Rosalie’s estate,
but could give little or no information concerning
them.</p>

<p class='c005'>The plantation was sold under the mortgage, and
when all was done, and the final accounts cast up,
Mark Sutherland found that of all his wife’s splendid
fortune, but a paltry two thousand dollars was left.</p>

<p class='c005'>With this, Mark Sutherland prepared to leave the
neighbourhood of Cashmere. But the day that he
had fixed for his departure was signalized by a
catastrophe that delayed his journey for weeks. It
was the dreadful death of St. Gerald Ashley, who,
during a fit of mania-a-potu, threw himself from a
second story window, and, striking his head upon the
iron trellis below, was instantly killed.</p>

<p class='c005'>India was distracted—Clement Sutherland helpless.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>And Mark remained at Cashmere to take the direction
of the funeral.</p>

<p class='c005'>Three days from the death, when all was over,
Mark Sutherland sought the presence of the widow.
He went to her with no tender condolements, but
with the words of bitter truth and stern rebuke
upon his lips. He found her in her faded and dingy
boudoir.</p>

<p class='c005'>She arose at his entrance, and held out her hand to
welcome him, but before his own had touched it, she
sank down in her chair, burst into tears, and covered
her face with her hands.</p>

<p class='c005'>He took a seat, and spoke:</p>

<p class='c005'>“I come to you, Mrs. Ashley, with no vain words
of sympathy, which would seem as untrue to your
sense as they would <em>be</em> upon my lips. I come merely
to set before you the stern realities of your position,
and, if possible, to awaken you to its duties and responsibilities.”
He paused a moment, and she lifted
up her head and tearful face, saying,</p>

<p class='c005'>“Speak, Mark! you will not find me haughty
now!”</p>

<p class='c005'>His lips curled, and then he compressed them.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Your husband is dead! You know too well what
fatal power brought down that high, proud nature to
dishonour and to death”——</p>

<p class='c005'>“Speak—ay, speak—and spare not! I deserve
it! Most of all, from you!” she exclaimed, in a voice
of anguish.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yet, India, for the kindred blood in our mutual
veins—for the regard I once bore you, and the anxiety
I still feel for you—I would point out a way of recovery”——</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>“Tell me, Mark! tell me! Oh! I know that I
have been guilty! but not wantonly guilty, as you
think! God knoweth that I have not! <em>One</em> mad,
impatient act—<em>one</em> frantic act—led to all the rest—ruined
all my life and his!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yet that act could not have been committed by
any but an intensely selfish nature, India. I speak
not to indulge in <em>vain</em> reproaches, but to recall you to
a sense of what you have already caused others to
suffer, and to a consciousness of what you owe to
others. You cannot now recall the past, but you are
very young, and the long future is all yours. Your
husband is dead, your father imbecile, and there is no
one to take the direction of affairs on this plantation.
You must rouse yourself from vain regret and indolent
self-indulgence. You were not created to sit still
and be waited upon. You must engage in the active
duties of life. You must redeem the past by the
future. You cannot now bring back St. Gerald Ashley
from his dishonoured grave, and restore him to
the brilliant and distinguished position from which he
fell—but you can do somewhat to save his memory
from reproach. He died heavily in debt. You have
property of your own. This seat of Cashmere was
secured to you on your marriage, leaving your father
a life interest in it. I do not, therefore, mean <em>this</em>.
But you have other property in your own right—devote
it to the liquidation of Ashley’s debts. And
more; when you estranged him from your bosom, he
sought sympathy and affection from a poor girl who
lives in the pine forest. I need not tell you the story;
doubtless, you know it. If you do not, the theme is,
unhappily, so common, that you can easily imagine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>it. What I mean to say is this: this poor, fallen
girl is unprovided for, desolate, and heart-broken;
and what I have to enjoin upon you is, that you seek
out that poor victim of St. Gerald’s sin, and make
such a provision for herself and child as will save her
from despair and deeper vice.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And if I do all this—if I spend all that I have in
clearing St. Gerald’s memory from debt, and if I take
this poor girl and her child under my protection—will
you think of me more leniently than you do? Will
you restore me your esteem?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My thoughts, my esteem, should be no motive with
you. I never asked you to do this for <em>my</em> sake. I
would not ask you to do it for heaven’s sake; but
simply I enjoin you to do it because it is <em>right</em>,
whether I ever remember your existence again or
not.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh! Mark, I will do it. But you have not learned
of Him, that divine, compassionate One, who would not
break the bruised reed or quench the smoking flax!”</p>

<p class='c005'>She raised her eyes tearfully, doubtingly, to his
face.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Is there anything else, Mark?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, India, your people; remember, that if your
life should be cut off before you emancipate them,
when your soul is in the spiritual world, you will see
those whom you have left on earth, doomed, with their
children and their children’s children, to a bondage,
from which you have no longer the power and the
privilege to free them. Oh! I think, India, it is a
fearful responsibility, it is an awful one, to die and
leave them so—to let the power of righting their
wrongs pass away from you forever.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>“To do all this it would require nearly all my
means—it would leave me very poor.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“<em>Be</em> poor! <em>let</em> all go but peace of mind.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She paused a long time with her head bowed upon
her hands. At last she looked up, and stretched her
hand out to him, and said—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mark, is this all that you require of me?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No; your father is imbecile in mind, and no longer
capable of directing even his most trivial affairs. You
must apply to the court for the necessary authority,
and take the control of his estate. I will remain here
a few weeks longer to aid you in obtaining it, and in
settling up the accounts. You will find many a just
debt which nevertheless cannot legally be recovered
of him. You must pay them all without flinching,
though the settlement should leave you penniless.
You must right every wrong that he has done, or
others suffered through him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He had not taken the hand she had held out to him
a few minutes before. It had fallen unheeded at her
side. Yet now she laid it in his, as she asked:</p>

<p class='c005'>“And if I do all this that you demand, <em>then</em> will you
give me back regard?”</p>

<p class='c005'>He looked disappointed and annoyed, and dropped
her hand, as he replied:</p>

<p class='c005'>“If the fountain be not sweet, how shall the stream
be? If the motive be not pure, how shall the act be?
India! do not seek to make a trader’s bargain with
heaven, or even with me! I have not asked you to
do this from the fear of any punishment, or the hope
of any reward; I have not required it at your hands
for God’s sake, least of all for mine; I have simply
demanded it in the name of the <span class='fss'>RIGHT</span>! India! there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>is a sentiment expressed, a principle laid down, or a
prayer made, by one of our poets, which, for sublime
simplicity, transcends everything not written in the
Holy Scriptures. It is contained in the lines of Pope’s
Universal Prayer:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘What conscience dictates to be done,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Or warns me not to do—</div>
      <div class='line'><em>This</em> teach me more than <em>hell</em> to shun,</div>
      <div class='line in2'><em>That</em> more than <em>heaven</em> pursue.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“There is no clap-trap there, India; it is a sublime
rule! Lay it to heart!”</p>

<p class='c005'>He had arisen, and was about to leave the room,
but seeing her arms crossed upon the table, and her
head fallen upon them in an attitude of the most
desolate grief, he turned back, and laying his hand
kindly upon the bowed head, he said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dear India, I am writing to Rosalie; shall I tell
her to come down and remain with you for a few
weeks?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, no! not now! I could not bear her presence
here; it would bring back the memory of happier days,
in too dreadful contrast with these. Not now! It is
very dark, life is very dark to me, and I am very weak
and miserable!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dearest India! I wish you would let her come to
you—would let her lead you to the only true source
of light, and strength, and joy!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I cannot! I can <em>die</em>!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“She would teach you to live; she would teach her
truth, that ‘out of the <em>heart</em> are the issues of life’”—</p>

<p class='c005'>“And of <em>death</em>!” said India, in a hollow voice.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then he could only press her hand, and leave her.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>Mark Sutherland remained three weeks longer in
the neighbourhood of Cashmere. During his stay he
lodged at the village of C., because he found it impossible
to remain at Cashmere, where the presence of
India, in her grief and desolation, seemed to scorch his
very soul like a spiritual fire. He laboured very industriously,
and, with the assistance of efficient lawyers
and clerks, reduced the chaos of the Cashmere accounts
into something like order, and made the way straight
for the future course of India and her attorney. At
the end of the third week he completed his work, and
bade adieu to India and to Cashmere.</p>

<p class='c005'>And in twelve days he was at home again. He was
met near the house by Billy, who, with two baskets upon
his arms, was proceeding upon some household errand.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well! and so it’s you, is it!” observed that functionary,
setting down his baskets. “And so you’ve
comed at last!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“How is your mistress, Billy?” inquired Mr. Sutherland.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not bein’ of a nigger, hain’t got no missus. Ef you
means <em>her</em>, in yonder, how does you ’spects her to be
being, along o’ the school and the head-eat-oriels, and
the clients? You better go see how she is! Yes,
and I can tell you, you better go see arter your paper,
<em>too</em>! or you won’t have any ’scribers left!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why, how so?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Humph! how so? Why Mr. Bolling, he took it
into his head as he’d write a great head-eat-oriel leader—I
could o’done it as well myself ef I’d had anybody
to take down my words in writin’—’cause I used to be
a <em>class</em> leader, or least way I used to belong to a class.
Well, unbeknownest to Mrs. Sutherland, Mr. Bolling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>he puts on his spectacles and sits down to write a
leader. Lord, it took him a week, and then it took a
whole side of the paper to print it! And when it come
out—ugh! whew! brikey! my eyes! ef it didn’t put
the whole town and county into a hubbub. <em>Every</em>body
was mad, and threatened to stop their paper—the
Dimocrats said how you’d turned Whig; and the
Whigs said you’d turned Dimocrat; and the Consarvatives
said you’d become a revolutioniser and a ’cendiary;
and the Free-S’ilers said how you’d betrayed
your pairty! If you could get ’lected to a lamp-lighter’s
place <em>this</em> go, <em>I’m</em> a Hunker!” said Billy, hitching up
his baskets, and trudging off towards the town. Very
much disturbed by what he had heard, Mark Sutherland
hastened on homeward. That his paper was
injured, and his income diminished, were comparatively
small matters; that his election was lost, was
not a very great one; but that public confidence was
shaken, and his influence impaired, was a misfortune.
Anathematising Mr. Bolling’s both-side-isms, which
now seemed to have reached <em>all</em>-side-ism, he passed
through the green gate leading into his own lawn.</p>

<p class='c005'>Rosalie, who had seen his approach from afar,
came down from the house to meet him. She looked
smiling and happy, as she gave him both her hands.
Her cheerful confidence raised his hopes. He greeted
her fondly, and then drew her arm within his own.
And as they walked slowly back to the house—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, Rosalie!” he said, “what about this confounded
editorial of Mr. Bolling’s? It is not enough,
it seems, that he should be a kill-joy in the house and
by the fireside, but he must be a mar-plot abroad, and
an evil genius to our business!”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>Rosalie laughed gaily.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, it is nothing,” she said; “it was just one of Mr.
Bothsides’ grand, broad, impartial manifestoes. It
took our people, both friends and opponents, very
much by surprise, perplexed them not a little, and
finally made them laugh. No one, for an instant,
could have attributed such a leader to you, even if
they had not been advised of your absence and exclusive
engagement elsewhere. Besides, in to-day’s paper
the publisher explains that the article was from the
pen of a transient contributor. Why do you still look
so grave? It is not possible that poor, daft Billy has
really alarmed you with his gossip. Psha! even innocents
of Billy’s mental calibre could scarcely impute
the sentiments of that foolish leader to you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Grave! Well he might look grave; but not upon
the subject of leading editorials, public sentiment,
popular applause, or popular execration. He wondered
now, how such trifles could have discomposed him.
There <em>she</em> was—the angel of his life—walking by his
side, leaning on his arm, looking very smiling and
happy, talking cheerily, laughing sweetly; but, oh!
that face was so fair and wan—that pearly forehead so
greatly developed, so polished from the tension of the
skin—those large, shadowy eyes, so deeply luminous—those
crimson flushes in the hollow cheek, so intense
and fiery—that whole countenance, irradiated with
such unearthly, supernal light! Why should he look
grave? He answered her question in some trivial way—said
he was not grave, or something to that effect,
and put on a look and manner of ease and light-heartedness—strangers,
alas! to his bosom, from this
time forward many a day! He did not now express
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>any anxiety, or care, or thought about her health! he
did not even ask her how she was; for oh! such feelings
had suddenly grown too deep, too real, too painful
to be spoken. He did not support her steps with
his usual tenderness and solicitude. A sort of fierce
jealousy and antagonism to disease and death took
possession of him—a sort of instinct that, by denying
their existence, he might disable their might—a kind
of feeling that, by disbelieving Rosalie’s weakness,
and disallowing her yielding to disease, he might save
her from the power of death.</p>

<p class='c005'>With more refined spiritual insight than he possessed,
Rosalie perceived his thoughts and emotions;
and, as much as possible, avoided giving him pain. She
never betrayed weariness, if the exercise of the greatest
fortitude and patience could conceal her sufferings;
she never complained, never even alluded to her mortal
illness.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the political world, the next year, the spirit of
party ran very high. A great moral as well as
national problem agitated and divided the whole
country. Mark Sutherland had been nominated by
the Human Rights as their candidate for the United
States Senate; he had accepted the nomination, and
his friends laboured perseveringly and anxiously for
his election. Rosalie, as usual, entered heart and
soul into all his toils and anxieties. “And not for
ourselves, dearest Mark,” she said; “not for our own
profit or vainglory—for that were a poor, mean,
narrow motive, and a low, selfish aim!—nor for your
own personal honour, Mark—though to him who is
worthy of it, to him who appreciates and accepts its
duties and responsibilities in the right religious spirit,
a seat in the American Senate is a great honour—nor
even for your future fame, Mark—not from any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>or all these motives do I wish and pray and toil for
your success—but for the sake of the place and
power it will confer upon you of doing good; of
speaking appropriate truths before the proper audience;
of succouring the oppressed; of defending the
right! For this I hope, and trust, and labour, and
would, if need were, die!”</p>

<p class='c005'>And upon another occasion, when he was vexed
and harassed, wearied and despondent, and inclined
to give up the object as little worthy the labour or
the pains, she said to him, sweetly—for her very tone
and manner had a soothing, encouraging spell—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Remember what Mountford says: ‘Fame is a great
thing for a man; it is silence for him when he wants
to speak; it is a platform to preach from, more authoritative
than a monarch’s throne; it is an affectionate
attention from a multitude of hearers.’ Win fame,
Mark—win the silence that will wait for your voice;
the platform more authoritative than the monarch’s
throne; the reverential attention of multitudes!
Only let sounds of words of truth and justice fall
upon the silence; principles of righteousness speak
from the platform; and the confiding attention of the
crowd be riveted to the glorious right!”</p>

<p class='c005'>High, inspiring words of holiness like these fell
daily from her lips. But Rosalie was dying—dying
all the faster because her failing oil of life was consumed
so ungrudgingly—her lamp of life shone so
brightly, giving light where it was needed. Yes,
Rosalie was dying, and her husband did not dream
of it. Soothed into rest by her own sweet patience,
and by the slowness and beauty of her failure, he did
not dream of it! He left her with an increased burden
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>of duties. At the urgent entreaties of his political
friends, he went to show himself among the voters
of the western counties. He was absent about
a month, during which she toiled for “the good
cause” faithfully—saying, when her strength was
failing, “There will be time enough for rest hereafter;
I must ‘work while it is yet day, for the night
cometh wherein no man can work.’” And so, at
the close of her daily school duties, she only left
her school desk to seat herself in the editor’s vacant
chair; and the hours that should have been spent
in recreation and rest, and the hours that belonged
to sleep, were devoted to the interests of “the paper,”
and the cause it supported—to writing editorials,
to reading and answering letters, examining exchanges,
and propitiating or putting down opposition.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mark Sutherland returned at the end of the month,
with the flush of hope upon his cheek, the light of
anticipated triumph in his eyes; but both light
and colour faded from his face at the sudden sight
of Rosalie’s brilliant eyes and burning cheeks.
Was it strange that he never was struck by her
illness, except upon meeting her after an absence?
On the contrary, I think it was natural, for a few
days accustomed him to her appearance; and her
sweet patience, her cheerfulness and hope, mesmerised
him into peace and joy. But this time, as he
drew her into the house, he said—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Indeed, Rosalie, you must, you <em>shall</em> give up your
school. You are not strong enough to continue it!
Besides, it is not needful. My election is nearly
certain, and then another sphere and other more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>graceful, agreeable, and lady-like amusements will
await you, dearest.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Rosalie smiled.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dear Mark, whenever you make a circuit among
our hardy country people, you come back thinking
me more fragile than ever, from the contrast.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And so she reassured him—and oh! he was very
willing to be reassured—and she continued the charge
of her school—anxious for every good principle she
could instil into the minds of her young pupils—saying
to herself, “These little ones will hereafter be
the wives and mothers of law-makers, as all our people
are law-makers; they will live in an era when American
women will have more influence upon the destinies
of the nation than they dream of now. That influence
must be for the right; I must sow the good seed, and
cultivate it while I live, that, after I die, the germ
may grow and flourish, and bring forth much fruit in
other lives!”</p>

<p class='c005'>But the day came at last when her school had to be
closed, and the labourer was obliged to rest from her
labour. It was during the afternoon session of a
certain Friday—a day never to be forgotten by the
young girls, who loved their gentle teacher with enthusiastic
devotion—in the midst of one of the class-exercises—a
little <em>extempore</em> lecture on their history
lesson—that a sudden failure of strength drew all
colour from her face, her head dropped forward on
her desk, and she swooned. And after this she did
not teach. Her school was opened but once more,
and for the last time. It was the day that she received
her pupils for the purpose of bidding them farewell.
It was quite a cheerful parting on her part, saddened
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>by no vain repining; on theirs, darkened by no vision
of the shadow of death. She made it the occasion of
a little festival, that her children’s last reminiscences
of her might be associated with pleasant thoughts;
and yet it was an earnest parting, too, that she sought
to sanctify to their good. In taking leave of each
dear girl, she laid upon the heart of each a text of
Scripture, suited to the individual need, to be remembered
for her sake, and acted upon until they should
meet again. For instance, Regina’s besetting sin was
ambition, and with her she left, “What shall it profit
a man, if he gain the <em>whole world</em> and lose his own
<em>soul</em>?” and to Augusta, who had a haughty mind, she
said, “<em>Pride</em> goeth before a fall, and a haughty spirit
before destruction;” to Maud, who had a high temper,
she whispered, “A <em>soft answer</em> turneth away wrath,
but grievous words stir up anger;” to little Alice, who
was poor and neglected, and inclined—child as she
was—to despondency, she said, “Blessed are the <em>meek</em>,
for they shall inherit the earth;” to Fanny, who was
an impetuous, impassioned child of impulse, she said,
“He that <em>ruleth his own spirit</em> is greater than he who
taketh a city.” All these the affectionate girls promised
to lay to heart, and act upon until they should meet
their teacher again. Only Fanny said she hoped their
dear teacher would not treat them as Lycurgus did
the Spartans, and leave them laws to be obeyed during
her absence, and then go away, never to return. A
cloud passed over the sunshine of Rosalie’s countenance;
but after a little hesitation she said, “If I live,
dear girls, I will return in the spring.” And soon
after saying this, she dismissed all the bright-eyed,
light-hearted children to their homes.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>Rosalie had been directed by her physician to spend
the fall and winter in the South. She had an old,
standing engagement to spend a few months in Louisiana,
at the house of the Lauderdales, with whom she
had kept up a regular correspondence. But, previous
to embracing this opportunity of benefitting her health
by accepting the invitation, Rosalie wrote to her step-mother,
telling her frankly of the feeble state of her
health and the precarious tenure of her life, and of the
order of her physician relative to her removal South;
but expressing, at the same time, her dread of the
inconvenience and trouble to which her illness and
death at their house might possibly subject her host
and hostess. There could but one possible answer to
such a letter suggest itself to the mind of Rosalie’s
affectionate step-mother—it was an answer in her
own person. Accordingly, in about two weeks from
the day that Rosalie mailed her letter to Mrs. Lauderdale,
that lady arrived at Shelton, stopping only long
enough at the hotel to write a note to Mark Sutherland,
requesting him to break the news of her presence
to Rosalie, and then come and take her to his wife.</p>

<p class='c005'>The meeting between Rosalie and her step-mother
was most affectionate and tender; but the patience
of Rose and the self-possession of Mrs. Lauderdale
restrained their mutual agitation. Mrs. Lauderdale
had come, in person, to take her step-daughter to
Louisiana, that she might nurse and watch over her
during the journey. And as soon as she found herself
alone with Mark Sutherland, she said—</p>

<p class='c005'>“And you must let her go at once, dear Mark. She
is iller than you think, and the mornings and the evenings
are already chill in this bleak clime. Yes, dear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>Mark, you must let her go at once; and if you cannot
possibly leave your political interests here, you may
confidently trust her to me on the journey, for I love
her as my own child, and will not leave her, night or
day; and you can join us as soon as you get through
this bustling and bothersome election.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, I will never suffer her to go without me. I
will accompany her—attend upon her. I will never
leave her again. Let the election go. What is success
to me, if I lose her? You do not know all that
she has been to me—all that she is to me—Mrs. Lauderdale!
I tell you, if she should sink into the grave,
earth could not offer me a boon so welcome as the
half of that grave!”</p>

<p class='c005'>A few days after this, the whole party set out for
the South, and in a little more than a week arrived at
the beautiful home of the Lauderdales.</p>

<p class='c005'>Lincoln Lauderdale met and received them with
hearty cordiality. Upon the very day that Mrs. Lauderdale
had left home to go up the river and visit her
step-daughter, she had written to Mrs. Wells, and invited
her to come to Louisiana to meet her daughter-in-law,
and perhaps her son. This was done by the
kind-hearted little lady with the purpose of effecting
a reconciliation between the long-estranged members
of the family. And now, on reaching home again,
among the letters upon her boudoir table she found
one from Mrs. Wells, saying that the Doctor had gone
for an indefinitely long absence to California, and that
she should be pleased to accept the invitation of Mrs.
Lauderdale, who might expect her about the middle
of the month.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And the day after to-morrow is the sixteenth, so,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>Mark, you may daily expect the arrival of your
mother,” said Mrs. Lauderdale, looking up from the
epistle. And then she told them of her invitation.</p>

<p class='c005'>Upon that very afternoon Mrs. Wells arrived. The
meeting between herself and her son took place alone,
by her request. It was not known what happened at
that interview, except that she sobbed a long time on
his shoulder, and that a full reconciliation ensued. To
Rosalie her manner was very affectionate.</p>

<p class='c005'>But Rosalie, from the time of her reaching Fairplains,
failed very fast. She now seldom left her easy
chair by the western window. It was the pleasantest
and most beautiful room in the house that had been
assigned the invalid—a room occupying the first floor
of a whole wing of the house, and with its east windows
looking far out upon the green alluvion that
stretched to the sandy beach of the distant gulf, and
with its west windows opened upon a beautiful garden,
beyond which spread fields reaching out to the
dark pine forest that stood stately against the sunset
sky. At this sunset window was her favourite afternoon
seat; and here, with her friends grouped around
her, she smiled and conversed as sweetly, as cheerfully,
if more faintly, than ever; or here, with only
her husband seated by her side, she would sit with
her thin hand in his, looking into his eyes with such
infinite, unutterable love and devotion, as though she
would transfuse all her mind, and soul, and spirit
into his being, to strengthen him for his life’s trial
and work.</p>

<p class='c005'>Every mail brought him piles of letters from his
political friends and correspondents: but they lay
unanswered, unopened, upon his secretary. Sometimes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>she would inquire about the prospects of the
party; he could tell her little, he thought little, he
cared little about it; and she would fix her mild eyes
in mournful wonder upon him.</p>

<p class='c005'>Soon the pleasant seat by the sunset window was
given up for the couch, and too soon the couch was
left for the bed, from which she was never to rise
again. Then it was, after her confinement to her bed,
that they approached a subject that both had hitherto
avoided discussing together—her dissolution. She
still spoke to him of the good cause—the cause of justice,
truth, and freedom. She implored him to let no
individual sorrow draw him away from his labours of
love to the whole race of man; rather to consecrate
that sorrow to their service. And still she inquired
about the prospects of his election to the Senate. She
so much wished to see him in the possession of place
and power before her death.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not alone for your sake, dearest Mark,” she still
repeated; “not alone for your sake, but for the sake of
humanity.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, dearest Rosalie, why should I wish for success?
When you have left me, what motive of action have
I on earth?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“A motive higher than any my life could supply
you with—the service of God, the good of man.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And all this time piles of accumulated and accumulating
letters from political partisans lay unopened and
unanswered, on his forsaken secretary.</p>

<p class='c005'>At last the day of death came—a clear, beautiful
day, that, after the noontide glory, waned without a
cloud.</p>

<p class='c005'>Rosalie lay sleeping on her bed; her pale gold hair,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>unconfined by a cap, lay floating on the pillow; her
wan face was as white as the linen pillow-case against
which it rested; her thin, blue-veined arm, uncovered
from the loose muslin sleeve, was white as the counterpane
upon which it lay. She slept calmly for a
while, and then her bosom was agitated by a slight
flutter; it came a second and a third time; and then,
with a start and a gasp, she awoke, opened her eyes,
and gazed wildly about for an instant; then her
glance fell on Mrs. Wells, sitting watching by her
bed-side. That lady arose, and, bending affectionately
over the invalid, inquired—</p>

<p class='c005'>“What do you want, dearest? Will you take your
composing draught now?”</p>

<p class='c005'>The eyes of the death-stricken Rosalie softened into
self-possession and quietness, and she answered faintly,
“No, mother, not now. Where is Mark?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“On the piazza, dear.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Sleeping?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No; waiting for his darling to awake.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Send him to me, mother. I wish to see him alone.”
The lady stooped, and pressed a kiss upon the chill
brow of the dying girl, and without suspicion went
out; and in half a minute Mark stood over Rosalie.</p>

<p class='c005'>She raised her eyes, a little wild with the life-struggle,
to his pale face.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My hour is come; I am going, dear Mark; I am
going! Turn me over on my right side, facing you.
Sit down by me, so that I can see you to the last!
Hold my hand!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Agonised with grief, yet by a powerful will controlling
his feelings, he raised her light form, and turned
her as she desired. And then he wished to call assistance;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>but with an imploring look and gesture she
arrested his purpose, and said,</p>

<p class='c005'>“Useless, dear Mark! useless all. Oh! sit near me,
where I can see you till the last, and so—part in peace
sweetly.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She lay upon her right side, with her face towards
him, with her fair hair floating back upon the pillow,
with her blue eyes raised with unspeakable love to
his countenance, with her left hand lying helplessly
over the white counterpane.</p>

<p class='c005'>He sunk down into the chair by her side; he took
her chill hand in his own warm one; he gazed upon
her dying face. And, as he gazed, a slight spasm agitated
her fair throat, quivered over the sweet lips, and
gave place to a heavenly smile. She sought to speak,
but her words sank in quivering music—her eyes
fixed upon his eyes—pouring their last light in streams
of unutterable love into his soul—and so they remained,
until the heavenly spirit left them dim in death.</p>

<p class='c005'>And still he sat gazing upon the dead face, holding
the cold hand, until a noise in the piazza disturbed
him, and words and tones of joy and triumph fell upon
his ear—and a familiar voice, asking—“Where is
Mark? Where is he? I swore to be the first to congratulate
him, and I’ll do it! I will not be hindered,
I tell you!” and in another instant Uncle Billy burst
into the room, and, overjoyed, bewildered, <em>blinded</em>,
rushed upon Mark, who had risen to prevent him,
seized both his hands, exclaiming exultingly—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Judge Sutherland, you are elected, sir! Sir, by
an unprecedented vote! Allow me the honour of
being the first to pay my respects to our Senator!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mark Sutherland grasped his visitor’s hand with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>overmastering force, and silently pointed to the still,
pale form upon the bed.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Bolling drew nigh, in sudden awe and grief;
and his heart almost stood still, as he inquired, with
hushed tones—</p>

<p class='c005'>“<em>Dead?</em>”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No!” replied Mark Sutherland, reverently,—“<span class='sc'>Immortal!</span>”</p>

<p class='c004'>Oh life! Oh world and worldly honour! how
poor and vain, how worthless and worse than worthless,
how bitterly mocking do ye seem in the
presence of death, the death of the best-beloved!
What now to him was his political victory? what
the success of his party? the cause of the country?
aye, of the world, or of humanity? Nothing, and
less than nothing! if that could be. He had called
her “immortal”—making what stand he could against
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>the overwhelming sense of annihilation that had fallen
upon him. Alas! alas! he felt now as if nothing were
immortal but his own bitter, insupportable grief;
as if with her all things had passed from him—leaving
only insufferable sorrow. And he lifted up
his voice, and wept—“Oh, Rosalie! Rosalie! life of
my life!” But let us not intrude upon a grief so
sacred.</p>

<p class='c005'>Pass we by the next few mournful days. Pass we
by the funeral, where all who had known the angel in
her mortal life, gathered around to gaze once more
upon her sweet face, drop a tear to her lovely memory,
and go away, haply, wiser, and more loving than they
came.</p>

<p class='c005'>Pass by the time when the news of her departure
from this earth reached her distant Western home,
and many other homes that felt the blessing of her
influence and mourned her loss; and where to this
day the memory of Rosalie is still fresh and beautiful,
sweet and fragrant—even as that of some fair
saint, who lived, and loved, and toiled, and suffered to
benefit humanity, to whom she was given; and where
the present thought of Rosalie is as that of some
bright guardian angel, still blessing from heaven those
she loved upon the earth.</p>

<p class='c005'>Pass to the time when Mr. Sutherland’s official
duties called him to Washington City. The first
vehemence and severity of his sorrow was over—but
not the sorrow: it had settled rather into a fixed and
silent melancholy, from which no earthly interest was
strong enough to arouse him. Even the fine powers
of his mind seemed palsied for a time.</p>

<p class='c005'>He reached Washington, the goal of his young ambition;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>was duly sworn in, and took his appointed seat
in the Senate Chamber. But all this passed to him like
a dream, or at least like a form in which he had no
vital interest. It was well for Mark Sutherland that
he was a man of very imposing presence—that his
bearing was dignified and commanding, and his fine
Roman features, even in the deepened repose, as in a
painting, or a marble bust, still expressed a high degree
of intellect; as, through that fortuitous accident
of physique, taken together with his antecedents, which
were not those of a negligent politician—his mental
abstraction passed for the pride and reserve of a
lofty mind—which it was <em>not</em>—rather than for the profound
indifference, amounting almost to apathy, of a
deeply stricken heart—as it <em>was</em>.</p>

<p class='c005'>Time passed, and the “affairs of the nation” got
slowly under way. And the “assembled wisdom” of
the commonwealth took up its profoundest problems.
Debate after debate arose, and questions in which he
had once taken the profoundest interest—but they
had now no power to affect or inspire him.</p>

<p class='c005'>Into society he did not go at all; but left the Capitol
only for his boarding-house, and his boarding-house
only for a ride or a walk out into the country.</p>

<p class='c005'>So the session passed, and Mr. Sutherland had failed
to distinguish himself, or to do credit to his constituents.
He had apparently done no service to himself,
his party, humanity or heaven. His best friends
were surprised, grieved and disappointed in him.</p>

<p class='c005'>He returned home; met his constituents with the
same apathetic, frozen indifference.</p>

<p class='c005'>What was the matter?</p>

<p class='c005'>It was scarcely credible even to himself that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>sorrow that had fallen upon him—a sorrow no heavier
apparently than that which falls upon many a man
and woman, who nevertheless “take up their burden
of life again,” and go on—should have so paralyzed his
intellect and his will.</p>

<p class='c005'>Had all his motive power departed with Rosalie?
Had she been the secret and the fountain of his
mental and moral force? He had often said so and
thought so, during her mortal life; and now it seemed
to be demonstrated. He once thought of resigning
his seat in the Senate, and spoke of his failing health
as a reason for doing so; but his personal friends dissuaded
him from his half-formed purpose. And about
this time Lincoln Lauderdale wrote and invited Mark
Sutherland to join him in a trip to England. Mr.
Sutherland accepted the invitation.</p>

<p class='c005'>The friends met by appointment at St. Louis, and
travelled in company to New York, and embarked
together for Liverpool.</p>

<p class='c005'>The voyage was made. The summer was spent in
travelling through England, Scotland and Ireland.</p>

<p class='c005'>And in the autumn they returned to the United
States, and reached Washington City just before the
meeting of Congress.</p>

<p class='c005'>The trip had been made without much benefit to
the health and spirits of Mr. Sutherland. And Mr.
Lauderdale, with much uneasiness in regard to the state
of his friend, took leave of him in Washington, and
departed for the South.</p>

<p class='c005'>The two Houses of Congress organized, in the
course of time, and the nation’s business commenced.
And again Mr. Sutherland sat a mere silent, handsome
figure-head in his seat.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>In fact, it required—not travel and change of scene,
not the offices of friendship, nor the distinctions of
society, but some powerful emotion, something that
should sound a trumpet-call to his heart and brain—some
mental or moral shock—to rouse that dormant
mind to life and action.</p>

<p class='c005'>And it came! In the midst of a calm as profound as
a sleep of peace, the thunderbolt fell that struck consternation,
not only among all right-thinking men
upon the floor of Congress, but all honest souls to the
remotest bounds of the Union. It was in the midst
of the temporary calm I have just mentioned, that a
Senator arose and presented a bill for the repeal of a
treaty hitherto held so sacred that the most reckless
of political adventurers had not dared to dream of
meddling with it until now.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was no very extravagant figure of speech to call
that event a thunderbolt. It took the Senate, the
House, and the nation by surprise. It had the
momentary stunning effect of a thunderbolt when it
fell. Men were struck with consternation, heard as
doubting the evidence of their own senses, and for a
time remained dumb with astonishment.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then followed indignation which we all know to
be anything but a “dumb devil,” whether it possess
a man or a body of men. And a tempest of opposition
arose that in its turn provoked a storm of assault
from the friends of the bill, and then the war raged
fast and furious. Not very “parliamentary” was the
character of the debates upon that question, for it was
indeed a time that “tried men’s souls,” “what manner
of spirit they were of.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Sutherland was among the foremost, most earnest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>and strenuous among the opponents of the bill. I have
said elsewhere that if Mark Sutherland were remarkable
for one trait above all others it was for his severe
sense of <em>justice</em>. It was this that had led, or rather
driven him to his early sacrifices; it was this that had
governed all his conduct and changed the whole current
of his life. And it was this sense of justice
stung to the quick that had roused the dormant faculties
of his mind, and woke his spirit “all the stronger
that it slept so long.” With all his strength of
intellect and will, he wrought in the cause of national
good faith and political righteousness, both at stake
in the issue of the pending act. Other men, abler
men, older men, veterans in the political arena, toiled
with equal zeal and greater power, and long and faithfully
was the contest kept up. All that man could
do to prevent that breach of political faith was done;
but, alas! the powers of evil carried the day: the bill
was passed, the sacred treaty repealed, and the cause
of justice lost at least for the time.</p>

<p class='c005'>At the close of this the second session of his services,
Mr. Sutherland returned once more to his home and
to his constituents, who received him with cordiality;
he had done what was possible for the cause of right.
Thus six years passed in the distracting life of a politician,
six years since his Rosalie went to heaven,
and still Mark Sutherland was a lonely man. He
now entered society freely, both in Washington City,
during the session of Congress, and at the various
watering-places, or at home in his own adopted State.
But neither the rustic beauty of the country maidens
in his own neighbourhood, nor the refined grace of
the city belles that yearly congregate at the capital,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>had been able to attract his heart from its fidelity to
the memory of his sainted Rosalie. And at the end
of six years’ widowhood, though still in the early
prime of life, eminently handsome and graceful, and
as distinguished for elegance and accomplishments in
the drawing-room as for talent and eloquence in the
Senate chamber; though honoured by the country and
courted by society; though constantly thrown among
the young, the beautiful, the gay and the fascinating;
though admired by women as well as distinguished
by men—Mark Sutherland was still alone—still faithful
to an earthly memory that had also become a
heavenly hope, and his angel wife, Rosalie, had no
mortal rival.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>And where, during all these years, was India, the
once fair, though faulty “Pearl of Pearl River?”
Alas! how many a ship-wrecked voyager there is
upon the strands of life—still making what stand he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>can against the overwhelming waves of despair that,
in every advancing tide, threaten to sweep him to
utter destruction! Oh life! oh mystery of life! when
and where shall be found thy true solution?</p>

<p class='c005'>When India had administered upon the estate of
her deceased father, who had survived the discovery
of his guilt but a few months,—when she had settled
every just claim upon it,—she found herself, as she
had predicted, very poor. When the last debt was
paid, the surplus fund was so small that it would not
have met even her moderate expenses for one year.</p>

<p class='c005'>And the once haughty India, haughty now no
longer, found it necessary to do something for her
own support. In a legal point of view, it was not by
any means obligatory upon India to impoverish herself
to pay her father’s or her husband’s debts. A
portion of the property, sufficient for her own comfortable
and even elegant maintenance, she might still
have withheld from the creditors; but with a late though
noble sense of justice—emulative of Mark’s own strict
rectitude—she resolved to pay the uttermost farthing,
and clear, as much as possible, from blame the memory
of the dead, by cancelling, at least, their pecuniary
obligations; even though by doing so she should
leave herself quite penniless. In vain her friends and
neighbours remonstrated. India, once so obstinate in
wrong, could be equally firm in right.</p>

<p class='c005'>The estate settled, the creditors all paid off, all other
claims of justice satisfied, and India, with a small
surplus, turned to consider what next she should do.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the South, luxurious houses enough were open
to her. All—even those who would fain, out of
kindness, have persuaded her to reserve a portion of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>her fortune from the claims of justice—were eloquent
in the praise of that high sense of honour that led her
to disregard alike her own self-interest and their
benevolent counsel. And many among the wealthy
families of her acquaintance, with true Southern
hospitality, invited and pressed her to come and make
their house her home for as long as she liked. And
there is no doubt but that the high-born, beautiful,
and accomplished young widow, would have been
considered a great acquisition in the drawing-room
of any country house. But at no time of her life
would India have endured such a life of luxurious
dependence—and even now, when her heart had been
disciplined and chastened by sorrow, she much preferred
the honest independence of labour. Therefore
she gratefully and somewhat proudly, withal, declined
the invitations of her friends, bade them kindly adieu,
and left the neighbourhood.</p>

<p class='c005'>Something of the old haughty reserve remaining,
perhaps, induced her to cover her retreat. And so—many
of her friends—Mark among others—had quite
lost trace of her.</p>

<p class='c005'>And she, also, had lost sight of <em>all</em>, except of Mark
Sutherland, whose rising star she watched from afar,
with mingled emotions of pride, joy, and passionate
regret.</p>

<p class='c005'>She had effectually hidden herself in the great city
of New York, where, as a teacher of music and drawing,
she lived in strict retirement, and whence she
watched the upward progress of the successful
statesman.</p>

<p class='c005'>At the close of his first senatorial term, Mark
Sutherland had been set up as the candidate of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>liberal party for one of the highest offices in the gift
of the people. Political business, about this time,
called Mr. Sutherland to New York. He was received
with enthusiasm by the friends of his party, and when
his business was dispatched, he entered freely into the
fashionable society of the city.</p>

<p class='c005'>India had seen his arrival announced with the usual
flourish of the press trumpets. And every day she
saw his honours and his triumphs chronicled in the
morning and evening papers. She could not bear the
thought of meeting him in her poverty now. But in
that extensive wilderness of crowded buildings, called
New York, she believed herself as completely screened
from observation and discovery as though she had
been away in London or in Paris, or in a desert or a
forest. And she also felt assured that he had not
the slightest clue to her dwelling place.</p>

<p class='c005'>But it happened that, during his sojourn in New
York, Mr. Sutherland had consented, with feelings
partly of amusement and partly of annoyance, to sit
for his portrait, to adorn some lyceum or lecture
room. And the painting had been finished and hung
up, and had attracted crowds of his friends and admirers—for
a few days—and then had been left
“alone in its glory.”</p>

<p class='c005'>One morning, at an hour so early that it was highly
improbable he should find any other visitors there,
Mr. Sutherland went to the lyceum to procure a rare
volume on jurisprudence. The librarian was in his
stall, but otherwise the room seemed deserted.</p>

<p class='c005'>Perhaps Mr. Sutherland’s foot was light in stepping—perhaps
the carpet was thick and soft, or it might
be that the lady he presently saw standing before his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>portrait was so abstracted that she could not hear the
entrance of another visitor. At all events, she did not
perceive his approach, and Mr. Sutherland went past,
selected his volume, and had turned to go back, when
a casual glance at the lady, and a flutter of her brown
veil, disclosed to his astonished eyes the face of India.</p>

<p class='c005'>He could scarcely suppress an exclamation of joy.
His first impulse was to spring forward and greet her.
Had he been some years younger, he would have done
so on the spur of the moment; but age brings caution
and teaches self-restraint; and it was well he refrained,
for a second glance at that pale, impassioned face, with
those dark, burning eyes, fixed with such a fascinated
gaze upon the picture before her, warned him that by
no rude shock must that colourless, motionless woman
be approached.</p>

<p class='c005'>Softly and silently he drew away towards the other
extremity of the long room, where the librarian sat in
his stall.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mr. Ferguson, do you know the lady at the other
end of the room?” he inquired of that gentleman.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, I do not,” answered the librarian, after taking
a look at India.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nor where she lives, of course?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nor where she lives,” said the librarian, looking
up in some surprise.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I supposed her to be a lady that I once knew, but
I did not like to speak to her in uncertainty—that is
all,” said Mr. Sutherland, evasively.</p>

<p class='c005'>The librarian was a grave man, as it befitted a
custodian of grave books to be, and Mr. Sutherland’s
reputation for unvarying propriety of deportment was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>beyond cavil, so there was no quizzing, and their talk
ended there.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mark Sutherland went down into the lobby, considering
how best to introduce himself, without startling
Mrs. Ashley. He might wait until she should
come down, and then follow her home, ascertain her
address, and call upon her the next day; but there
appeared to him to be something about such a course
as that he did not approve, something romantic, absurd,
yet verging upon treachery. Besides, it was most
probable that she would take an omnibus, when he
should lose sight of her, unless, indeed, he should get
into the same omnibus; to which there was the same
great objection of presenting himself suddenly before
her, which, after seeing the expression of her face, he
dared not do; while, at the same time, it was the recollection
of that very look that made him doubly
anxious to meet her. After considering a while, he
determined to address a letter to her through the city
post-office. That would certainly reach her sooner or
later.</p>

<p class='c005'>He went home and put his purpose into execution.</p>

<p class='c005'>He was unfit for study or for society that day.
That sudden meeting with India, the revelation made
by that look upon her worn but still lovely face, had
stricken the rock in his bosom, and the long-sealed
fountain of memory and affection was set free.</p>

<p class='c005'>That motionless, colourless, most beautiful face—it
haunted him all the day.</p>

<p class='c005'>That afternoon he dressed to go to a dinner party,
at a house on Fifth Avenue. On arriving at the place,
just as he entered the hall, a lady closely veiled went
out. That form and air! he could not be mistaken!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>Again, with a start of irrepressible pleasure, he had
recognised India.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Who is that lady?” he inquired of the “Jeemes”
of that hall.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The music mistress, yer honour,” answered
“Jeemes,” who happened in this case to be “Patrick.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Do you know where she lives?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll inquire, yer honour,” replied Patrick, opening
the drawing-room door to admit the guest, and then
departing on his errand. In a few moments he returned,
with Mrs. Ashley’s address.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was in a distant part of the city. Yet gladly
would Mark have sought out her retreat that night,
had he been free to do so; but nothing but the most
urgent necessity could now have excused him from
the dinner got up in his own honour. So he was
forced to restrain his impatience for that evening.
Nay, more; having found out her residence and mentally
fixed the hour that he should see her the next
morning, he gave himself up to the festivities of the
evening, and was once more the brilliant conversationist
he was reputed to be. At dinner, he led in
and sat next one of the most charming women in
New York, and no doubt did his devoirs with equal
grace and pleasure.</p>

<p class='c005'>Yet neither is there any doubt that he was well
satisfied when the evening’s hospitality was over.</p>

<p class='c005'>And he was still better pleased when the night was
passed, and the morning came, and the sun arose, and
he at last had leave to dress himself, dispatch an early
breakfast, take a cab, and drive to the remote suburb
where India lived.</p>

<p class='c005'>Was it a private dwelling or a boarding-house?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>The address gave no clue to that question—it designated
only the street and the number. He hoped it
was a private dwelling! He must see her alone!
How would she receive him? There was no mistaking
that look upon her face that had thrilled him,
striking the whole “electric chord” of memory and passion!
that look of mingled affection, aspiration, and
passionate regret! How would she receive him?
Such were the glad, anxious, questioning thoughts
that chased each other through his mind, while the
cab rolled on. In these tumultuous, half-delightful,
half-painful recollections and anticipations the distance
was passed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“This is the place, sir,” said the driver, as the cab
drew up before a little cottage, surrounded by a small
luxuriant flower garden, and literally covered and
concealed by a complete thicket of tall rose-trees and
climbing vines.</p>

<p class='c005'>“So this is a private dwelling, and her love of
beautiful surrounding survives all the crash of fortune
and the wreck of life,” thought Mark Sutherland,
as he alighted and opened the gate leading into the
yard.</p>

<p class='c005'>Let us precede him, by a few moments.</p>

<p class='c005'>India, who had risen from an almost untasted breakfast,
had passed into the small parlour only to escape
the eyes of her attendant, the pretty, loving Oriole,
who had followed the fortunes of her mistress with
the most devoted affection and fidelity, and who, if a
cloud did but fall upon the brow of Mrs. Ashley, reflected
it in the sadness of her own face.</p>

<p class='c005'>But this morning, in the bitterness of her emotions,
India could not endure the sad, wistful glances of poor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>Oriole; so she had left the small sitting-room impatiently,
and passed into the parlour, where she paced
up and down with the fearful, half-suppressed excitement
of some caged lioness.</p>

<p class='c005'>Disciplined and chastened as her heart certainly
had been in the trials of her life, India was still very
far from Christian perfection. And, perhaps, now she
needed a little of the sunshine of happiness, as well as
the long, long cloud of sorrow, to nurture the growth
of goodness in her heart. At all events, she found it
very difficult to bear with fortitude the mortification
and grief of the night before. She had met
him on the steps of one of those Fifth Avenue palaces,
where her pupils resided. She had met him! he had
passed her, brushing her dress as he went! Though
her veil was down, she had recognized him. And she
knew by the start that he made, he recognized <em>her</em> as
well! Yet he had passed without speaking! Ah! all
her thoughts of the future possibilities of a rencounter
that she dreaded and shrunk from, had not shaped a
meeting so humiliating as this! She <em>had</em> feared that
he would seek her out, and, from his pride of place,
presume to patronize her, by endeavouring to improve
her circumstances, giving her advice, offering her assistance—humiliations
which to escape she would
have fled to an alms-house—or, perhaps, plunged into
a river, “but for the grace of God,” for India was but
half regenerated. But a rencounter so mortifying as
this, she had never dreamed of. All the circumstances
attending that chance meeting also combined to make
it inexpressibly galling—<em>he</em> going into that house an
honoured guest, for whom its saloons were illuminated
and a feast prepared, and a choice company gathered:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>she creeping out of it, a sort of hired servant with
her wages in her hand. So, in the present bitterness
of her mood, she looked at herself. And they had so
met upon the steps, and he had seen her, recognized
her, and passed her without speaking! “Ah! fool!”
so she thought; “there was little need to dread that
he would seek me out to benefit me. The ‘great
statesman’ evidently has no wish to be bored by his
poor relations. But oh, Mark! Mark! that <em>you</em> should
have done such an unworthy thing! <em>you</em>, my one
saving idea of manly excellence—that prosperity
should have corrupted, and the world hardened, even
<em>you</em>! When you upbraided me so bitterly, in the
midst of my sorrows at Cashmere, I bore it all with
a meekness—not very like <em>me!</em> because—oh! because
I <em>saw and felt</em> what you would never acknowledge to
your own heart—the secret, unacknowledged feeling
that gave point, sting, and acrimony to all the bitter
reproaches you uttered. Oh! Mark, in that day I
read your heart as a woman only can! But all this
is over—over—and you pass me without recognition,”
she said, sinking into a chair, dropping her head upon
her hands, and giving way for the first time in years
to a passionate flood of tears.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hark! the bell rings—Oriole goes to the door. It
is probably the postman, and India is too much depressed,
and has too little to hope, to care much about
the coming of that messenger of joy or of woe to so
many households. But hark!</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why, how do you do, Oriole? Do you recollect
me, child? Yes? I am very glad to see you here!
How is your mistress? Is she in?”</p>

<p class='c005'>It is a rich, full-toned voice that speaks—a cordial,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>familiar, life-giving voice—a voice that has power to
thrill every nerve in her frame—in a word, it is Mark
Sutherland’s voice! and he is in the little hall, and in
another moment he will be in the room.</p>

<p class='c005'>Oh! Heaven! her face is pale, and bathed with
tears—he must not see her thus! In a moment the
blinds are drawn down, the curtains dropped, and the
room obscured, and her chair is wheeled around
with its back to the windows, so as to throw her face
into deep shadow. So she will await him. But Oriole
enters alone, with a card.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is Mr. Sutherland, madame, and if you are disengaged
he will be glad to see you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She bows in assent—she can do no more; and
Oriole goes out, returns, and ushers in Mr. Sutherland.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mrs. Ashley”——</p>

<p class='c005'>She rises, and extends her hand.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mrs. Ashley, I am very happy to see you again.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She essays to speak, but fails, and her self-possession
utterly deserts her. The hand he has taken
is cold as ice—he carries it to his lips.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My dearest India, I am so happy to find you
again, after all these years.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“All these years!”—she repeats his words, mechanically,
as she sinks back in her chair.</p>

<p class='c005'>He takes the nearest seat, and resumes—“I have
sought you far and wide, I have sought you for so
long, I have done all but advertise you!” He added,
smiling—“Why have you hidden yourself so long from
all your friends?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The old ‘sinful pride’ perhaps, Mark,” she answered,
half smiling in her turn.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>“‘Pride,’ dear India? Ah! I understand you. Yet
that same pride, in all its phases, has caused much
vexation to those who love you, dear India.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Do I not know it? And do I not regret it?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And to none has it caused more trouble than to
<em>myself</em>.”—But the conversation is growing personal,
and closing in.</p>

<p class='c005'>You and I, reader, are <i><span lang="fr">de trop</span></i>—and will withdraw
from the scene and wait.</p>

<p class='c005'>The result was this—that Mr. Sutherland did not
leave New York as soon as he had expected, by
many weeks.</p>

<p class='c005'>And one Sunday, before morning service, there was
a quiet marriage ceremony performed before the altar
of Grace Church.</p>

<p class='c005'>And the next morning, in the list of passengers that
sailed in the Baltic, for Liverpool, were the names of
“Mr. and Mrs. Mark Sutherland, and two servants”—the
latter being Oriole, who could not live without her
mistress, and Mr. Sutherland’s valet, who was no
other than our old friend Billy Button, who had been
well drilled for some years past, and now, in a speckless
suit of black, and a spotless white neckcloth, presented
one of the most respectable specimens of a gentleman’s
gentleman.</p>

<p class='c005'>And in the meantime, Mr. Sutherland’s elegant
country seat on Lake Crystal, in one of the most
thriving of the Western States, was left under the
charge of that grand, impartial, large-hearted, broad-visioned
specimen of manhood, Mr. Billy Bolling, who
had received a <i><span lang="fr">carte-blanche</span></i> for fitting up and refurnishing
the house; for, however uncertain any one might
be as to Mr. Bolling’s opinions, no one could doubt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>his <em>taste</em>, which was really exquisite. And that gentleman
took the greatest possible delight in preparing
the mansion for the reception of the bride.</p>

<p class='c005'>And, by the way, Mr. Bolling, by his universal
agreeableness, conquered such a popularity in his
own district, that he has been talked of for the Legislature,
and would certainly have been made a candidate,
only it seemed impossible by any means to arrive at
his politics, he being claimed with equal reason by all
parties.</p>

<p class='c005'>Early in the winter, Mr. and Mrs. Sutherland returned
to the United States. They went first, by invitation
and pre-engagement, to spend a month among
their relatives in the South.</p>

<p class='c005'>They went to Texas, where they found Mrs. Wells,
still a hale and handsome woman, though on the
shady side of fifty, and the Doctor more appreciative
of her real worth, and more attached to her now than
he was at the period of his mercenary marriage.
They spent one happy month with the Wellses, and
then, accompanied by Mrs. Wells, went into Louisiana,
to pay a long-promised visit to Lincoln Lauderdale
and his vivacious little lady.</p>

<p class='c005'>They found them well and prosperous, and surrounded
by a thriving young family. Little change
had time made in Lincoln or the piquant “Nan.” A
month was whiled away in their pleasant society, and
so it was near spring before the Sutherlands, still
accompanied by Mrs. Wells, set out up the river for
their North-Western home.</p>

<p class='c005'>And it was quite spring when they reached the
beautiful shores of Lake Crystal, and entered their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>own elegant home. Mrs. Wells remained with them
and spent the summer.</p>

<p class='c005'>And she still continues to come every year to spend
her summers with her “beloved Mark,” her “only child.”
Mark and India occasionally return those visits in the
winter—that is, when Mr. Sutherland’s official duties
permit him to do so. For Mark Sutherland is still a
rising politician, adored by one party and abhorred
by another. And, in the present hopeful state of the
public mind, it is impossible to predict of any given
contest whether the people mean to elect or mob their
own candidate.</p>

<p class='c005'>But, aside from Mr. Sutherland’s public life, his
home is a very happy one. In his profession he has
realized a handsome fortune. By the death of her
Uncle Paul, at an advanced age, India has inherited
a large property, so that they are entirely independent
in their pecuniary circumstances. India is as beautiful
but no longer as proud as Juno, Queen of Goddesses,
and is the centre of a very refined and intellectual circle.
They have two fine children—a beautiful boy, whom
they named Mark—and a lovely little girl, whom they
called India.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mrs. Sutherland, in a mood of magnanimity, proposed
that this child should be christened Rosalie;
but Mr. Sutherland could by no means be brought to
consent to that. No! the child must have its mother’s
name—only hers. And so she had. India was flattered
and pleased. And Mark Sutherland was exactly
right.</p>

<p class='c005'>Was Rosalie then forgotten?</p>

<p class='c005'>No! no! and a thousand times no! She was well
remembered. Her name was a sacred, sacred name,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>that he could not bear to give to another creature.
It was hers and hers only; it represented <em>her</em> individuality;
it stood to him for all that was most beautiful,
pure, lovely and sweet—aye, heavenly! He could not
bear to bestow it upon India’s child, passionately as
he loved that child and its mother. Reader, do you
understand that? India had once been his boyhood’s
passion, as she was now his manhood’s love. He preferred
her immeasurably before all living women. She
was a handsome, intellectual, and warm-hearted woman,
eminently fitted to make a man like Mark Sutherland
happy. And his marriage with her was eminently
happy.</p>

<p class='c005'>The beautiful India was his Hertha, but there was
one who had gone before who was and <em>is</em> his Psyche.
And deep in his heart is a chamber into which no
mortal creature entereth—a sanctuary closely veiled
from all human knowledge—a holy of holies, sacred
to one earthly memory and one heavenly hope—consecrated
to the veiled worship of his angel wife—</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
